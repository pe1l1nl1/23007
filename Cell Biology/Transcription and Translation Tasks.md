### Tasks for understanding TRANSCRIPTION and TRANSLATION

**Task 1. Understanding the complementarity principle.**
1. a) Write down what would the complementary strand look like:
DNA:
- plus strand (leading): 5’ - TAC TAC GGT AGG TAT ACC TTG - 3’  (template)
- minus strand (lagging): 3’ - ATG ATG CCA TCC ATA TGG AAC - 5‘ (coding)

```text

A DNA molecule is double-stranded. One strand of the molecule is the template strand and one is called the coding strand. 

template:
ACACGGCTTAA
TGTGCCGAATT
coding:

The bases will always pair A with T and C with G.

When the RNA polymerase transcribes the DNA it reads only the template strand. It will pair the appropriate nucleotides with their partners on the template strand of DNA using A, C, G and U (U replaces T in RNA)

template:
ACACGGCTTAA
UGUGCCGAAUU
RNA:
```

2. b) Transcribe the DNA sequence given above into a mRNA (hint: you should pay attention to which of the two strands is actually transcribed?)
- the template strand is transcribed
- mRNA: 3’ - AUG AUG CCA AUA UGG AAC - 5’



```text

In transcription, the DNA sequence of a gene is "rewritten" in RNA. In eukaryotes, the RNA must go through additional processing steps to become a messenger RNA or mRNA.

In translation, the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA is "translated" into a sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide (protein chain).

```
**Task 2. Understanding translation (use the printouts of Genetic code tables).**
- a) Translate the given mRNA molecules into an amino acid sequence (hint: first codon starts at 1st nucleotide, i.e., first reading frame)! You can use either the 1-letter or 3-letter code, or both!
  
1. AUGGGGAUUGUACUAACUUGCCACCGCUAA
2. GGGAACUUCUGGCAGGUUCCCAGGUCUUAG

How would example No 2. above look if you translated it in the second reading frame?


- b) By using the genetic code table, write down the possible nucleotide sequence that has been encoded for the given peptide!
1. Met-Val-Ile-Leu-Ser-Ser-Ala-Trp-Stop
2. M-W-G-E-P-R-L-L-*

**Task 3. The codon/anticodon issue. **
Fill in the anticodons based on the given codons. Name the second amino acid. (Hint: use the genetic code tables and the example of first anticodon given in the table).


| Amino Acid        | Possible codon (5’-3’)       | Corresponding Possible Anticodon (3’-5’) |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Threonine    |   ACU      |UGA       |
|              |   ACC      |            |
|              |   ACA       |            |
|              |   ACG   |            |
|      ?        |  GCU    |            |
|              |   GCC      |            |
|              |   GCG     |            |
|    Proline |  CCU        |            |
|              |   CCC   |            |
|              |   CCA     |            |
|              |   CCG      |            |
