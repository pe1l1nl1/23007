### Tasks for understanding TRANSCRIPTION and TRANSLATION

**Task 1. Understanding the complementarity principle.**
a) Write down what would the complementary strand look like:
DNA:
plus strand (leading): 5’ - TAC TAC GGT AGG TAT ACC TTG - 3’ 
minus strand (lagging): _’ - __________________________ - _‘

b) Transcribe the DNA sequence given above into a mRNA (hint: you should pay attention to which of the two strands is actually transcribed?)
mRNA: _’ - ___________________________________ - _’

**Task 2. Understanding translation (use the printouts of Genetic code tables).**
a) Translate the given mRNA molecules into an amino acid sequence (hint: first codon starts at 1st nucleotide, i.e., first reading frame)! You can use either the 1-letter or 3-letter code, or both!
1. AUGGGGAUUGUACUAACUUGCCACCGCUAA
2. GGGAACUUCUGGCAGGUUCCCAGGUCUUAG

How would the example No 2. above look if you translate it in the second reading frame?


b) By using the genetic code table, write down the possible nucleotide sequence that has encoded for the given peptide!
1. Met-Val-Ile-Leu-Ser-Ser-Ala-Trp-Stop
2. M-W-G-E-P-R-L-L-*

**Task 3. The codon/anticodon issue. **
Fill in the anticodons based on the given codons. Name the second amino acid. (Hint: use the genetic code tables and the example of first anticodon given in the table).


| Amino Acid        | Possible codon (5’-3’)       | Corresponding Possible Anticodon (3’-5’) |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Threonine    |   ACU      |UGA       |
|              |   ACC      |            |
|              |   ACA       |            |
|              |   ACG   |            |
|      ?        |  GCU    |            |
|              |   GCC      |            |
|              |   GCG     |            |
|    Proline |  CCU        |            |
|              |   CCC   |            |
|              |   CCA     |            |
|              |   CCG      |            |
