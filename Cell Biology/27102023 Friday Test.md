1. **Subunits of Sweat Gland**:

Sweat glands are composed of two main parts: the secretory unit and the duct. Let's break down the structure and function of these components:

   - **Secretory Unit**: The secretory unit of the sweat gland is responsible for producing the primary sweat secretion. It consists of the following cells and structures:
     - **Clear Cells**: These are the main secretory cells in the sweat gland. They are pyramidal in shape, have a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, and numerous mitochondria. Clear cells play a vital role in secreting sweat.
     - **Dark Cells**: These cells are found among the clear cells and contain granules. They assist in modifying the primary sweat secretion.
     - **Myoepithelial Cells**: Located around the secretory unit, myoepithelial cells contract to help expel sweat from the gland.

   - **Duct**: The duct is responsible for transporting the sweat from the secretory unit to the skin surface. It's composed of:
     - **Stratified Cuboidal Epithelium**: This epithelial lining consists of multiple layers of cuboidal cells that play a role in reabsorption of ions and secretion of various constituents into the sweat.

**Location of Aquaporins**:
Aquaporins, which are water channels, are present in both the clear cells and duct cells. They facilitate the movement of water through cell membranes. In the clear cells, aquaporins are predominantly found on the apical (luminal) membrane to allow water entry into the cell during sweat production. In duct cells, aquaporins are found on both the apical and basolateral membranes, aiding in the reabsorption of water.

2. **Ultrastructural Features**:

   - **Clear Cells**: Clear cells are responsible for primary sweat secretion. They have a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to synthesize proteins and a high number of mitochondria to provide energy for active transport. These features aid in the production and secretion of sweat by enabling the synthesis of sweat components and providing the necessary energy for transport.

   - **Dark Cells**: Dark cells contain granules, which are thought to be involved in modifying the primary sweat secretion. However, their ultrastructural features are not as well defined as clear cells.

3. **Role of Cell Junctions**:

   - **Gap Junctions**: Gap junctions are important for cell-to-cell communication. In sweat glands, they allow the exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent clear cells, aiding in synchronization and coordination of sweat secretion. These junctions are found between neighboring secretory cells.

   - **Tight Junctions**: Tight junctions form a barrier between cells in the duct, creating a selectively permeable layer. They prevent the backflow of sweat and regulate the movement of ions and water into the sweat duct. Tight junctions are located in the apical region of duct cells.

   - **Desmosomes**: Desmosomes are cell adhesion structures that help hold adjacent cells together. While not directly involved in sweat secretion, they provide structural integrity to the gland and ensure the integrity of the duct and secretory unit.

4. **Transport Mechanism for Sweat Production by Clear Cells**:

Clear cells secrete sweat through a two-step process:

   - **Active Transport**: Clear cells actively transport sodium and chloride ions from the surrounding interstitial fluid into the cell. This is accomplished via ion pumps and transporters located in the basolateral membrane. These ions create an osmotic gradient, drawing water into the cell.

   - **Passive Diffusion**: Water moves passively through the aquaporins in the apical membrane of clear cells, following the osmotic gradient created by ion transport. This combination of active ion transport and passive water movement leads to the secretion of sweat into the gland lumen.

5. **Reabsorption Mechanism by Duct Cells**:

Duct cells play a role in reabsorption and modification of sweat. They reabsorb ions and water to concentrate the sweat before it reaches the skin surface:

   - **Reabsorption of Ions**: Duct cells reabsorb sodium and chloride ions through ion channels in their apical membrane.
   
   - **Reabsorption of Water**: Aquaporins in the apical and basolateral membranes of duct cells facilitate the reabsorption of water from the sweat. This reabsorption helps concentrate the sweat and conserve body fluids.

   - **Modification of Sweat**: Duct cells can modify the ionic composition of sweat by selectively reabsorbing or secreting ions, thus ensuring that the final sweat composition is suitable for thermoregulation.

Remember that the specific ultrastructural features and distribution of junctions can vary slightly between different sweat gland types (eccrine, apocrine) and their anatomical location (palms, soles, armpits, etc.).
