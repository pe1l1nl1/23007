# Connective Tissues 

## Functions of connective tissues 

1. Enclosing and separating other tissues
2. Connecting tissues to one another
3. Supporting and moving parts of the body
4. Stroring compounds
5. Cushioning and insulating
6. Transporting
7. Protecting

Figure 1. Dermal fibroblasts. There are many other cell types in the dermis, which are difficult to distinguish with general staining techniques.

Figure 2. Dermal fibroblasts. It is shown irregular dense connective tissues with fibroblasts found among thick collagen fibers (see electron microscopy 

**Fibroblasts** usually show one elongated nucleus and scarce cytoplasm. They commonly have a well-visible nucleolus, whereas fibrocytes do not, which may be a landmark to distinguish both cell stages. At transmission electron microscopy (fig 3-4), fibroblasts are larger, with more cytoplasm and abundant organelles (Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes) involved in extracurricular matrix synthesis.
