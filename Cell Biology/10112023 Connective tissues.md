# Connective Tissues 
   

## Describe the classification of connective tissue and give examples of each major type. 

**Connective tissue** is found throughout the body. It is usually characterized by large amounts of extracellular material that separates cells from one another. The extracellular material, or extracellular matrix, has three major components: 
1. protein fibers
2. ground substance consisting of nonfibrous protein, and other molecules
3. fluid

Three types of protein fibres help form most connective tissues. **Collagen** fibres, which resemble microscopic ropes, are flexible but resist stretching. **Reticular** fibres are very fine, short collagen fibres that branch to form a supporting network. **Elastic** fibres have a structure similar to that of coiled metal bed springs; after being stretched, they can recoil to their original shape. 

**Ground substance** is the shapeless background against which cells and collagen fibres can be seen when using a light microscope. Although the ground substance appears shapeless, the molecules within it are highly structured. **Proteoglycans** resemble the limbs of pine trees with proteins forming the branches and polysaccharides forming the pine needles. This structure enables proteoglycans to trap large quantities of water between the polysaccharides. 

Connective tissue cells are named according to their functions. Cells whose names contain the suffix *-blast* (germ) produce matrix; cells ending in *-cyte* (cell) maintain it; and cells ending in *-clast* (break) it down for remodelling. For example, **fibroblasts** are cells that form fibres and ground substances in the extracellular matrix of fibrous connective tissue, and **fibrocytes** are cells that maintain it. **Osteoblasts** form bone, **osteocytes** maintain bone, and osteoclasts break down bone. 

Also found in connective tissue are cells associated with the immune system. **Macrophages** are large white blood cells that are capable of moving about and ingesting foreign substances, including microorganisms, in the connective tissue. **Mast cells** are nonmotile cells that release chemicals, such as histamine, that promote inflammation.

## Functions of connective tissues 

1. **Enclosing and separating other tissues**. Sheets of connective tissue form capsules around organs, such as the liver and the kidneys. Connective tissue also forms layers that separate tissues and organs. For example, connective tissues separate muscles, arteries, veins, and nerves from one another. 
2. **Connecting tissues to one another.** Tendons are strong cables, or bands, of connective tissue that attach muscles to bone, and ligaments are connective tissue bands that hold bones together. 
3. **Supporting and moving parts of the body.** Bones of the skeletal system provide rigid support for the body, and semirigid cartilage supports structures, such as the nose, the ears, and the surfaces of joints. Joints between bones allow one part of the body to move relative to other parts. 
4. **Storing compounds.** Adipose tissue (fat) stores high-energy molecules, and bones store minerals, such as calcium and phosphate.
5. **Cushioning and insulating.** Adipose tissue (fat) cushions and protects the tissues it surrounds and provides an insulating layer beneath the skin that helps conserve heat. 
6. **Transporting.** Blood transports gases, nutrients, enzymes, hormones, and cells of the immune system throughout the body.
7. **Protecting.** Cells of the immune system and blood provide protection against toxins and tissue injury, as well as against microorganisms. Bones protect underlying structures from injury.

Figure 2. Dermal fibroblasts. It is shown irregular dense connective tissues with fibroblasts found among thick collagen fibers (see electron microscopy 

**Fibroblasts** usually show one elongated nucleus and scarce cytoplasm. They commonly have a well-visible nucleolus, whereas fibrocytes do not, which may be a landmark to distinguish both cell stages. At transmission electron microscopy (fig 3-4), fibroblasts are larger, with more cytoplasm and abundant organelles (Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes) involved in extracurricular matrix synthesis.
