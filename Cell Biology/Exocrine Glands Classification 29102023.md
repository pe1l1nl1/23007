- are exocrine glands distributed throughout the body surface. They are referred to as sudoriferous or sudoriparous glands (sudor = sweat in Latin).
- **Eccrine glands** are found all over the body and secrete a watery product that cools the skin.
- **Apocrine sweat glands** are mainly found in the armpits and perianal area and secrete a more viscous and odorous product.

There are several histological differences between these two types of glands, but they do share a common general structure. That is, they both consist of secretory and duct (excretory) segments.

### The classification of endocrine glands

The Endocrine glands, 
**Hypothalamus** regulates hunger, thirst, sleep and wakefulness plus most of your involuntary mechanisms including body temperature.
**P = Pituitary**  Controls all other endocrine glands, and influences growth, metabolism and regeneration.
**T = Thyroid** Regulates energy and metabolism 

**P = Parathyroid**  secretes the hormones necessary for calcium absorption
**A = Adrenal** secretes hundreds of compounds including cortisone and adrenaline which help you react to emergencies. Regulates your metabolic processes in the cells, water balance, blood pressure, etc. 
**P = Pancreas** aids in the digestion of protein, fats and carbohydrates. Produces insulin which controls blood sugar levels.
**O = Ovaries** Influences how your blood circulates and determines your mental bogot and your sex drive (testes in males).
**T = Testes**

### Draw and describe two types of glands (either exocrine or endocrine) 

- for example, a simple tubular gland and endocrine gland or a simple branched acinar and branched tubular gland.
- How to draw and describe these glands you can find in two sources – exocrine glands are best described in Wheater's Functional Histology, Seventh Edition, chapter "Epithelial tissues" and endocrine gland

### Pancreatic islet 

- I will only ask you to draw and describe one type – pancreatic islet which is described best in the Textbook of Histology, Fifth Edition (Leslie P. Gartner PhD), chapter "Digestive System: Glands".
