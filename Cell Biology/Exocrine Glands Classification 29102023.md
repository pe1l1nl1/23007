The question will be about the classification of exocrine and endocrine glands, in addition to the sweat gland question. You will have to draw and describe two types of glands (either exocrine or endocrine) for example, simple tubular gland and endocrine gland or simple branched acinar and branched tubular gland. How to draw and describe these glands you can find in two sources – exocrine glands are best described in Wheater's Functional Histology, Seventh Edition, chapter "Epithelial tissues" and for endocrine gland, I will only ask you to draw and describe one type – pancreatic islet which is described best in the Textbook of Histology, Fifth Edition (Leslie P. Gartner PhD), chapter "Digestive System: Glands".
