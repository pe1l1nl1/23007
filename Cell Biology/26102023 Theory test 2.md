1. The universal basis of membrane structure is the **phospholipid bilayer**. Phospholipids are the primary building blocks of biological membranes. They consist of a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and two hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails. In an aqueous environment, phospholipids naturally arrange themselves into a bilayer, with the hydrophilic heads facing outward toward the surrounding aqueous environment and the hydrophobic tails oriented inward, away from water.

This phospholipid bilayer forms the basic structural framework of cell membranes, including the plasma membrane that encloses cells and various organelle membranes within eukaryotic cells. The phospholipid bilayer provides a selectively permeable barrier that controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and cellular compartments, and it plays a fundamental role in maintaining cell integrity and function. While membranes can also contain proteins, cholesterol, and other molecules that influence their properties, the phospholipid bilayer is the foundational element of all biological membranes.

2. The chemical substance that can pass the plasma membrane via simple diffusion is **CO2 (carbon dioxide)**. CO2 is a small, nonpolar molecule that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. Simple diffusion is the passive movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, and CO2 can do this without the need for specific transport proteins.

3. The movement of molecules or atoms from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration is called **diffusion**. Therefore, the correct answer is "diffusion."

4. **Small hydrophobic molecules** can easily diffuse through the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane, composed primarily of a phospholipid bilayer, is selectively permeable to small, nonpolar molecules. These molecules can pass through the lipid bilayer via simple diffusion because they are soluble in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. In contrast, big non-charged polar molecules, ions, and charged molecules typically have difficulty diffusing through the lipid bilayer without the assistance of specific transport proteins or channels.

5. The plasma membrane double layer, also known as the phospholipid bilayer, is a dynamic structure. Therefore, the correct answer is **option C: "Is a dynamic structure."** The plasma membrane is not symmetric in molecule composition, and it is not glycolyzed in the cytoplasmic side. It is constantly in motion, with molecules moving within and across it to maintain its integrity and functionality.

6. Hormonal signaling is called **Endocrine** signaling. Endocrine signaling involves the release of hormones into the bloodstream, which can then travel to target cells or tissues at a distance from the source of the hormones.

7. Flippases, a family of transmembrane lipid transporter enzymes, are responsible for **Transverse diffusion of lipids**. These enzymes facilitate the movement of specific lipids from one leaflet of a lipid bilayer to the other, helping to maintain the asymmetrical distribution of lipids in cellular membranes. This process is essential for membrane structure and function.

8. **Active transport of a molecule/solute**:

 **Is required to transfer molecules/solutes against its concentration gradient**.

Active transport involves the movement of molecules or solutes against their concentration gradient, from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. This process requires the input of energy, often in the form of ATP, to drive the transport against the gradient.

9. The motor protein in cells that converts the chemical energy contained in ATP into the mechanical energy of movement is called **myosin**. Myosin is primarily associated with muscle contraction but is also involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell motility. It uses ATP hydrolysis to generate the mechanical force necessary for movement.

10. The process of ingestion of liquid into a cell by the budding of small vesicles from the cell membrane is known as **pinocytosis**. Pinocytosis is a form of endocytosis where the cell engulfs extracellular fluid and solutes in tiny vesicles formed by the invagination of the plasma membrane. This allows the cell to take in dissolved substances and nutrients from its environment. Pinocytosis is sometimes referred to as "cell drinking" because it is analogous to the process of a cell consuming a liquid.

11. The term "membrane-delimited intracellular transport carrier" typically refers to **vesicles**. Vesicles are small, membrane-bound structures that transport various molecules and substances within a cell. They play a crucial role in intracellular transport, moving materials between different organelles and compartments within the cell. Vesicles are formed by budding off from one membrane and then fusing with another membrane to deliver their cargo. This process allows for the transport of proteins, lipids, and other cellular components to their intended destinations within the cell.

12. A protein that plays a major role in the formation of coated vesicles is **clathrin**. Clathrin is a protein that assembles into a cage-like lattice structure on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or on the membranes of various organelles. This clathrin lattice aids in the invagination of the membrane, leading to the formation of coated vesicles. Clathrin-coated vesicles are involved in endocytosis, where they transport molecules, such as receptors, into the cell, and in intracellular transport, where they move materials between different compartments within the cell.

13. The amino acid sequence responsible for targeting a particular protein to specific intracellular compartments is known as a **signal sequence** or **signal peptide**. These sequences are often found at the N-terminus of a protein and contain specific amino acid motifs that act as molecular addresses, directing the protein to its intended cellular location.

For example, the signal sequence can target a protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the mitochondria, and it plays a crucial role in the sorting and trafficking of proteins to their appropriate destinations within the cell. Signal sequences are recognized by cellular machinery, including the signal recognition particle (SRP), which facilitates the transport of the protein to the correct intracellular compartment.

14. The major cellular activity responsible for molecular traffic between a variety of specific membrane-enclosed compartments is known as **intracellular transport** or **vesicular transport**. This process involves the movement of molecules, organelles, and other cellular components within the cell through the use of membrane-bound vesicles. Intracellular transport ensures that essential materials are delivered to their intended destinations and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular functions.

This process includes various mechanisms such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and the movement of organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and mitochondria. It is a fundamental aspect of cell biology and is crucial for the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells.

15. The specialized layer of cytoplasmic proteins on the inner face of the plasma membrane of the cell periphery that gives the outer surface of the cell mechanical strength is called the **cell cortex**. The cell cortex is primarily composed of various cytoskeletal proteins, including actin filaments and associated proteins, that provide structural support and help maintain the cell's shape and mechanical integrity. It is particularly important in cells with irregular shapes or those involved in processes like cell migration and cell division, where mechanical stability is crucial.

16. The thin, actin-rich plasma-membrane protrusions that function as antennae for cells to probe their environment are called **filopodia**. Filopodia are slender, finger-like extensions of the plasma membrane that contain bundles of actin filaments. They play a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell motility, adhesion, and sensing the extracellular environment. Filopodia are involved in processes like cell migration, neuronal growth cone guidance, and the exploration of the cell's surroundings.

17. The motor protein in cells that converts the chemical energy contained in ATP into the mechanical energy of movement is called **myosin**. Myosin is a key component of the contractile machinery in muscle cells, and it is also involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell motility. Myosin uses the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to generate mechanical force and movement, such as muscle contraction and the movement of cellular cargo along actin filaments.

18. Another term for the motor protein myosin, when specifically referring to its role in muscle contraction, is **"molecular motor"** or **"muscle motor protein."** These terms emphasize its function in generating mechanical force and movement within muscle cells.

19. **Dynein** is another motor protein found in cells, and it plays a significant role in intracellular transport. Dynein is responsible for moving cellular cargo along microtubules in a retrograde (toward the cell body) direction. It converts the chemical energy stored in ATP into mechanical movement, just like myosin. Dynein is particularly important for processes like axonal transport in neurons and the movement of organelles within the cell.

20. The vesicular transport process that provides outward transport of cellular vesicles is called **exocytosis**. Exocytosis involves the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of their contents into the extracellular environment. This process is essential for the secretion of various

21. The vesicular transport process providing outward transport of cellular vesicles is called **Secretory**. Secretory vesicles contain materials that need to be released from the cell, and their fusion with the plasma membrane during exocytosis allows for the external release of these contents.

22. The first steps of protein glycosylation, which involve the addition of simple sugar groups, occur in the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**. In the ER, newly synthesized proteins are modified by the addition of carbohydrate groups, primarily N-linked glycosylation. This initial glycosylation process is crucial for proper protein folding and quality control before proteins are further modified in the Golgi apparatus.

23. **True**. Sugar molecules (glycoproteins and glycolipids) can indeed be found on both sides of the plasma membrane. They are often exposed on the extracellular side of the membrane, where they play essential roles in cell adhesion, cell signaling, and the immune response. However, some glycoproteins and glycolipids may also be found on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, although their functions may differ in that location.

24. **False**. The cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane is typically **negatively charged** relative to the outside. This charge difference is primarily due to the presence of negatively charged molecules, such as proteins and phospholipids, on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This charge separation is essential for various cellular processes and helps to maintain the resting membrane potential, which is important for cell excitability and function.

25. **False**. New membrane synthesis in eukaryotic cells does not occur in ribosomes. Ribosomes are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis (translation) rather than membrane synthesis. Membrane synthesis involves the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and various other cellular organelles and structures. These organelles are responsible for the production, modification, and transportation of cellular membranes.

26. **False**. Lipid molecules, particularly phospholipids, do not typically flip-flop between the inner and outer layers of the plasma membrane. This is because the hydrophobic tails of phospholipids are repelled by the aqueous environment on both sides of the membrane, making it energetically unfavorable for them to switch from one layer to the other.

Instead, lipid movement within the bilayer occurs predominantly through lateral diffusion, where lipids move within their respective monolayers. Flip-flop (transverse diffusion) of lipids from one leaflet to the other is a relatively slow and energetically unfavorable process and is often facilitated by specific enzymes called "flippases" and "flopases." These enzymes help maintain the asymmetric distribution of lipids in the plasma membrane.

27. The fluidity of the plasma membrane is diminished if it contains **Cholesterol** in abundance. Cholesterol helps regulate the fluidity of the membrane by preventing the fatty acid chains of phospholipids from packing too closely together. This makes the membrane less fluid and more rigid. Cholesterol also plays a crucial role in maintaining membrane integrity and stability.

28. The proper folding of newly synthesized proteins is assessed by **Chaperones**. Chaperones are a class of cellular proteins that assist in the correct folding of other proteins, ensuring that they adopt their functional three-dimensional structures. Chaperones help prevent the aggregation of misfolded or partially folded proteins and aid in their correct folding. This process is crucial for protein quality control and maintaining cellular function.

29. Cell response to a signal is usually slow if it involves the changes in **gene expression**. Altering gene expression typically requires transcription and translation processes, which can take time. As a result, changes in gene expression are slower compared to more immediate responses like altering cell metabolism, secretion, or movement.

30. Intracellular signaling proteins can **relay** an incoming signal. They transmit the signal from one molecule or cellular component to another, ensuring that the message is effectively conveyed within the cell. This relay of information is crucial for coordinating various cellular responses to external or internal cues.

31. Steroid hormone signaling is the type of **endocrine** signaling that triggers the target cell by the help of **intracellular** receptors. The target cell's response to this signal is usually **relatively slow** because it involves changes in **gene expression.**

32. The type of contact that goes around the cell is called **adherens junction** or **adherens belt**. The type of contact that strongly binds basal epithelial cells to the connective tissue membrane is the **hemidesmosome**. Cell-to-cell contact that provides particularly strong attachment of epithelial cells is the **desmosome**. The type of cell-to-cell contact located at the most apical point between epithelial cells is the **tight junction**.

33. Basal lamina is C. a sheet of connective tissue fibers to which basally located epithelial cells are attached via hemidesmosomes.

The basal lamina is a structure that provides structural support for epithelial cells and serves as a barrier between the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue. It is a thin sheet of extracellular matrix proteins and glycoproteins to which epithelial cells attach, often via hemidesmosomes. While it is sometimes referred to as the "basal membrane," it is not exactly the same as the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells, which is why option B is not entirely accurate.

34. The transfer of substances across an epithelium by passing through the intercellular space between the cells is called **Paracellular transport**. This mechanism involves the movement of substances through the tight junctions and the intercellular space between adjacent epithelial cells.
