### Sweat Glands 

- are exocrine glands distributed throughout the body surface. They are referred to as sudoriferous or sudoriparous glands (sudor = sweat in Latin).
- **Eccrine glands** are found all over the body and secrete a watery product that cools the skin.
- **Apocrine sweat glands** are mainly found in the armpits and perianal area and secrete a more viscous and odorous product.

There are several histological differences between these two types of glands, but they do share a common general structure. That is, they both consist of secretory and duct (excretory) segments.

### The classification of endocrine glands

The Endocrine glands, 
**Hypothalamus** regulates hunger, thirst, sleep and wakefulness plus most of your involuntary mechanisms including body temperature.
**P = Pituitary**  Controls all other endocrine glands, and influences growth, metabolism and regeneration.
**T = Thyroid** Regulates energy and metabolism 

**P = Parathyroid**  secretes the hormones necessary for calcium absorption
**A = Adrenal** secretes hundreds of compounds including cortisone and adrenaline which help you react to emergencies. Regulates your metabolic processes in the cells, water balance, blood pressure, etc. 
**P = Pancreas** aids in the digestion of protein, fats and carbohydrates. Produces insulin which controls blood sugar levels.
**O = Ovaries** Influences how your blood circulates and determines your mental bogot and your sex drive (testes in males).
**T = Testes**

### Draw and describe two types of glands (either exocrine or endocrine) 

- for example, a simple tubular gland and endocrine gland or a simple branched acinar and branched tubular gland.
- How to draw and describe these glands you can find in two sources – exocrine glands are best described in Wheater's Functional Histology, Seventh Edition, chapter "Epithelial tissues" and endocrine gland

### Pancreatic islet 

- I will only ask you to draw and describe one type – pancreatic islet which is described best in the Textbook of Histology, Fifth Edition (Leslie P. Gartner PhD), chapter "Digestive System: Glands".


The pancreas islet, also known as the pancreatic islet or islets of Langerhans, is a vital component of the pancreas responsible for regulating blood sugar levels and producing hormones involved in glucose metabolism. The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach and plays a crucial role in both digestion and the endocrine system. The pancreas contains two main types of cells within the islets: alpha cells and beta cells. These cells have distinct functions and features:

**1. Beta Cells:**
   - **Function**: Beta cells are responsible for producing and secreting the hormone insulin. Insulin plays a central role in regulating blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body. When blood glucose levels rise after eating, beta cells release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by cells, allowing them to use it for energy or store it as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Insulin also inhibits the release of glucose from the liver, thus lowering blood sugar levels.

   - **Features**: Beta cells are sensitive to changes in blood glucose concentrations. They have glucose receptors that allow them to detect variations in blood sugar levels. When glucose levels are high, beta cells release insulin to bring them back within a healthy range.

**2. Alpha Cells:**
   - **Function:** Alpha cells produce and secrete the hormone glucagon. Glucagon has the opposite effect of insulin. When blood glucose levels are low, such as between meals or during periods of fasting, alpha cells release glucagon. Glucagon signals the liver to break down stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream, raising blood sugar levels. This process is known as glycogenolysis.

   - **Features**: Alpha cells respond to low blood glucose levels by releasing glucagon, which helps maintain adequate glucose levels in the bloodstream. The balance between insulin and glucagon is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

In addition to beta and alpha cells, the pancreatic islets also contain other cell types, including **delta cells** that produce somatostatin, which regulates the release of insulin and glucagon, and PP cells that produce pancreatic polypeptide, which can affect appetite and digestion.

The proper functioning of the pancreas islets is essential for overall health, as they help regulate blood sugar levels and ensure that the body has a steady supply of energy. Dysfunction of these islet cells can lead to conditions such as diabetes mellitus, where there is a disruption in glucose regulation, resulting in chronic high (in the case of type 2 diabetes) or low (in the case of type 1 diabetes) blood sugar levels.
