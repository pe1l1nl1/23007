# Introduction to Cell Biology 

## Prerequisite Knowledge
Prerequisite knowledge required for the acquisition of the course corresponds to the study programme admission requirements and the general knowledge, skills and competences obtained at the previous level of education.
 
## Study Course Abstract
The aim of this course is to impart basic knowledge about the chemical composition, structure and functions, cell interaction, active and passive transport across the membrane. The course will give an understanding about cell cycle, cell differentiation into tissues, senescence, programmed cell death and cellular interaction, as well as morpho-functional properties of cells differentiated into epithelial, connective, muscle and neural tissue.

L - lecture,
Ld - laborotory assignments

## Characterization of students' independent work organization and tasks
1. To study theoretic questions to prepare to laboratory assignment what are given in Laboratory protocols of E-studies. For study use lecture conspects and information from compulsory reading list.
2. To prepare protocols of laboratory assignment. Compare observed specimens with material in E-studies and literature to mark necessary cells, organoids and analyze their functions.
3. Before colloquiums and examination study specimens what were used in laboratory.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Students will acquire knowledgeâ€™s about cell structure and functions what are important for understanding of genetics, physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology.
Skills
2. Students will get skills to use modern microscopes, analyze microscopic samples, to recognize morphologic features of different cell types and to evaluate cell functional properties.
3. Students will aquire competences to explain most important processes of cell metabolism, mechanisms of differentiation and programmed cell death.
4. Students will understand and analyze morpho-functional properties of differentiated cells in epithelial, connective, muscle and neural tissue.

Students grade will be calculated as:

## Intermediate assessment:
1. 13 laboratory assignments (20%),
2. 3 colloquiums (successfully pass) (30%),
## Final assessment:
3. examination - (2 theoretical parts and 1 laboratory identification) (50%).
