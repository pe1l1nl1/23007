### Epithelia 

Questions for the next class:

**Topic - Epithelium**

You will have to draw two types of epithelia (for example stratified squamous nonkeratinized and pseudostratified), 
draw a 2D representation and describe at least 3 specific structural features or functions of the particular epithelium
name at least 2 locations where this type of epithelium is located in a human body


1. **Stratified Squamous Nonkeratinized Epithelium**:
   - **2D Representation**: Imagine multiple layers of flat cells stacked on top of each other.
   - Non-keratinized surfaces must be kept moist by bodily secretions to prevent them from drying out. Cells of stratum corneum are sometimes without keratin and living.

   - Section of the human skin showing the stratified squamous epithelial surface, referred to as the epidermis. The layer of keratin here is named the stratum corneum.
   - **Structural Features/Functions**:
     1. **Protection**: This type of epithelium provides protection against mechanical abrasion, pathogens, and chemical damage due to its multiple layers of cells.
     1. **Moisture Retention**: It retains moisture and prevents desiccation (drying out) due to the lack of keratinization.
     1. **Diffusion and Filtration**: It allows for the diffusion of gases and small molecules in regions like the oral cavity.

   - **Locations in the Human Body**:
     1. **Oral Cavity**: Lines the oral mucosa, including the inner cheeks and the surface of the tongue.
     1. **Esophagus**: Found in the lining of the upper part of the oesophagus.
     1. **Vagina**: Forms the mucosal lining of the vaginal canal.
     1. Examples of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium include some parts of the lining of the **oral cavity**, **pharynx**, **conjunctiva of eye**, **upper one-third oesophagus**, **rectum**,**external female genitalia**, and **vagina**.
     1. Even non-keratinized surfaces, consisting as they do of keratinocytes, have a minor superficial keratinized layer of varying thickness, depending on the age of the epithelium and the damage it has experienced.

2. **Pseudostratified Epithelium**:
   - **2D Representation**: Appears as if multiple layers are present, but all cells are anchored to the basement membrane.

   - Illustration depicting Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium.

   - **Structural Features/Functions**:
     1. **Mucociliary Escalator**: The presence of cilia on some cells helps move mucus and trapped particles along the surface, assisting in the removal of debris and pathogens.
     1. **Secretion**: Goblet cells in this epithelium secrete mucus, which helps to trap and remove foreign particles.
     1. **Protection**: Provides protection and lining to the respiratory tract.

   - **Locations in the Human Body**:
     1. **Respiratory Tract**: Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium lines the nasal passages, trachea, and bronchi.
     1. **Male Reproductive Tract**: Found in the epididymis and part of the urethra.
     1. **Auditory Tube (Eustachian Tube)**: Lines the auditory tube, connecting the middle ear to the nasopharynx.
     1. Ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia is the type of respiratory epithelium found in the **linings of the trachea** as well as other **respiratory tract**, which allows filtering and humidification of incoming air.[1]
     1. Non-ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia are located in the **prostate**[2] and **membranous part of male vas deferens**.
     1. Pseudostratified columnar epithelia with stereocilia are located in the **epididymis**. Stereocilia of the epididymis are not cilia because their cytoskeleton is composed of actin filaments, not microtubules.[3] 
     1. Pseudostratified columnar epithelia are found forming the straight, tubular glands of the **endometrium in females**.[4] They are also found in the **internal part of the ear**.


These epithelial types showcase the diversity of functions and locations within the human body. The stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium is primarily for protection and can be found in areas subject to abrasion and moisture, while pseudostratified epithelium has a role in both protection and secretion, especially in the respiratory and reproductive tracts.
