**History of University:**

The history of universities dates back to ancient times, with some of the earliest institutions of higher learning emerging in Greece and Rome. However, the modern university system, as we know it today, has its roots in the Middle Ages. The word "university" itself comes from the Latin word "universitas," which means a community or corporation.

**Obligatory 4 Faculties of a Full Spectrum/Classic University:**

In the classical university system, which was prevalent in Europe during the Middle Ages, there were four main faculties:

1. **Faculty of Theology:** This faculty focused on the study of religious texts, theology, and matters related to the Church. It was a central part of medieval universities given the strong influence of religion on society during that time.

2. **Faculty of Law:** This faculty was dedicated to the study of civil and canon law. Legal studies were crucial in medieval Europe, and this faculty produced lawyers, judges, and legal scholars.

3. **Faculty of Medicine:** The medical faculty dealt with the study of medicine, anatomy, and various aspects of healthcare. It trained physicians and other medical professionals.

4. **Faculty of Arts:** This faculty covered a broad range of subjects, including grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. It was the precursor to modern liberal arts education and provided students with a well-rounded education in various intellectual disciplines.

**Septem Artes Liberales - The Seven Liberal Arts:**

The seven liberal arts, also known as the septem artes liberales, were an important part of the curriculum in medieval universities. These arts were divided into two groups:

1. **Trivium:** The trivium consisted of three arts focused on language and communication skills:
   - **Grammar:** The study of language and its rules.
   - **Rhetoric:** The art of persuasive speaking and writing.
   - **Logic:** The study of reasoning and argumentation.

2. **Quadrivium:** The quadrivium comprised four arts related to mathematics and natural sciences:
   - **Arithmetic:** The study of numbers and basic mathematics.
   - **Geometry:** The study of shapes, sizes, and their properties.
   - **Music:** The study of harmonics and musical theory.
   - **Astronomy:** The study of celestial bodies and the cosmos.

**Peter Abelard and His Activities and Works:**

Peter Abelard (1079-1142) was a renowned French philosopher, theologian, and logician. He is best known for his works on ethics, theology, and his contributions to the development of scholastic philosophy. Some of his notable activities and works include:

- **Sic et Non:** Abelard's famous work where he presented pairs of contradictory statements from authoritative sources, encouraging students to engage in critical thinking and debate.

- **Theologia Summi Boni:** His theological treatise where he explored the nature of God and the concept of the highest good.

- **Dialectica:** Abelard's work on dialectics and logic, which played a significant role in the development of medieval scholasticism.

- **Teaching and Disputations:** Abelard was a prominent teacher and engaged in disputations (debates) with other scholars of his time, including Bernard of Clairvaux. These debates were a common method of learning and intellectual development in medieval universities.

**Three Basic Methods of Learning in the Early Universities:**

In the early universities of the Middle Ages, three fundamental methods of learning were employed:

1. **Lectio (Lecture):** Professors would deliver lectures, reading and explaining texts to students. This method was common for transmitting knowledge.

2. **Repetition (Repetitio):** After attending lectures, students were expected to repeat or recite what they had learned. This helped reinforce their understanding and memorization of the material.

3. **Disputation (Disputatio):** Disputations involved formal debates or discussions where students and scholars would engage in intellectual discourse, often involving the presentation and defense of arguments. This method fostered critical thinking and intellectual rigor.

These methods of learning were essential in the early university system and laid the groundwork for the development of higher education in Europe.

---- The later development ---- 

Three fundamental methods of learning encompass various strategies and approaches that individuals can use to acquire knowledge and skills effectively:

1. **Visual Learning:** Visual learning involves processing information through visual cues such as images, charts, graphs, diagrams, and written text. Visual learners benefit from seeing information presented visually and often use techniques like mind maps, flashcards, and color-coding to organize and remember information.

2. **Auditory Learning:** Auditory learning focuses on processing information through listening and hearing. Auditory learners learn best through spoken explanations, lectures, discussions, and audio materials. They often benefit from reading aloud and engaging in group discussions or debates to reinforce their understanding.

3. **Kinesthetic (Tactile) Learning:** Kinesthetic or tactile learning involves physical engagement and hands-on experiences to understand and retain information. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing, touching, and experiencing. They thrive in interactive and experiential learning environments, such as labs, workshops, and hands-on activities.

It's important to note that individuals often have a preferred learning style, but many people use a combination of these methods, known as multimodal learning, depending on the context and subject matter. Effective learning often involves incorporating various techniques and strategies that align with one's individual learning style and the nature of the material being studied.

1. **Healthy Nutrition and Its Role in Preventing Non-Communicable Diseases:**
   Healthy nutrition plays a crucial role in preventing, slowing the progression of, and even treating non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and endocrine disorders. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can help lower the risk factors associated with NCDs, such as high blood pressure, obesity, and high cholesterol. Additionally, proper nutrition can help manage these conditions once they develop, reducing the severity of symptoms and complications. A focus on healthy eating can also alleviate the burden on healthcare budgets by reducing the prevalence and severity of NCDs, leading to lower healthcare costs.

2. **Nutrition Pyramids, Harvard Plate, Suggested Proportions:**
   Nutrition pyramids and the Harvard Plate are visual representations of recommended dietary proportions. They emphasize a balanced diet that includes:
   - **Fruits and Vegetables:** A significant portion of the diet should consist of fruits and vegetables.
   - **Whole Grains:** Whole grains like brown rice and whole wheat are recommended.
   - **Proteins:** Lean sources of protein, such as poultry, fish, beans, and nuts, should be included.
   - **Healthy Fats:** Unsaturated fats like those found in olive oil and avocados are preferred.
   - **Moderation:** Sweets, red meat, and processed foods should be consumed in moderation.

3. **Macro and Micronutrients - Proteins, Carbohydrates, Fats:**
   - **Macronutrients:** These are nutrients needed in larger quantities. Proteins provide 4 calories per gram and are essential for tissue repair and immune function. Carbohydrates provide 4 calories per gram and are the body's primary energy source. Fats provide 9 calories per gram and are important for energy storage and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
   - **Micronutrients:** These are nutrients needed in smaller quantities, including vitamins and minerals.

4. **Calorie Malnutrition and Protein Malnutrition:**
   - **Calorie Malnutrition:** It refers to a deficiency or excess of calories in the diet. Insufficient calorie intake can lead to malnutrition, while excess calories can contribute to obesity.
   - **Protein Malnutrition:** Protein malnutrition, such as kwashiorkor and marasmus, occurs when there is a lack of adequate protein intake, leading to muscle wasting, weakened immunity, and other health issues.

5. **Visual Differences between Kwashiorkor and Marasmus:**
   - Kwashiorkor is characterized by edema (swelling due to fluid retention), a protruding belly, and skin lesions.
   - Marasmus results in severe muscle wasting, a skeletal appearance, and a sunken, emaciated appearance.

6. **Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Low-Fat Diets:**
   Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) require dietary fats for absorption. A diet too low in fat can lead to deficiencies in these vitamins, which play critical roles in vision, bone health, antioxidant protection, and blood clotting.

7. **Role of Water in the Human Body:**
   Water is essential for various biological processes, including digestion, circulation, temperature regulation, and waste elimination. It comprises a significant portion of bodily fluids and is vital for overall health.

8. **Dangers of Vegan Diet for Foetus and Young Children:**
   Vegan diets can be deficient in certain nutrients like zinc and vitamin B12. Inadequate zinc intake can affect growth, development, and the immune system. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological problems. Ensuring proper supplementation and diverse food choices is essential for vegan diets during pregnancy and infancy.

9. **Danger of Selenium, Vitamin D, and Iron Deficiency:**
   Deficiencies in selenium, vitamin D, and iron can lead to various health issues, including immune dysfunction, depression, anaemia, and rickets. These deficiencies are a concern in some European countries, including Latvia.

10. **Effects of Selenium, Vitamin D, and Iron Deficits in Students:**
    Deficits in these nutrients can lead to fatigue, reduced cognitive function, impaired immune response, and overall poor physical and mental health among students.

11. **Folic Acid Deficiency in Pregnant Women:**
    Folic acid deficiency during pregnancy can result in neural tube defects in the developing fetus, leading to serious and often irreversible birth defects. Adequate folic acid intake is critical for preventing these issues, which is why prenatal supplements often contain this nutrient.

Is there any specific treatment? How to differentiate TBE symptoms from influenza and Lyme’s disease.

1. **Iodine Deficiency and Its Effects:**
   Iodine is a crucial micronutrient that plays a vital role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which are essential for regulating metabolism and ensuring proper growth and development. A mild iodine deficiency can have significant consequences, particularly in Europe and Latvia, where iodine deficiency disorders were once prevalent.

   **Effects of Mild Iodine Deficiency:**
   - **Thyroid Dysfunction:** Even mild iodine deficiency can lead to an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), which can result in fatigue, weight gain, and goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland).
   - **Cognitive Impairment:** Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can impair fetal brain development, leading to lower IQ and developmental delays in children.
   - **Goiter:** Iodine deficiency often manifests as goiter, which is the visible enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck.

   **Importance of Addressing Iodine Deficiency:**
   Iodine deficiency is important to address because it can have long-lasting and irreversible effects, especially in pregnant women and children. Cognitive impairments and developmental delays can impact a person's quality of life and potential.

   **Consequences of Mild to Moderate Iodine Deficiency:**
   - **Lower IQ:** Children born to mothers with iodine deficiency may have lower IQs and decreased cognitive abilities.
   - **Goiter and Thyroid Issues:** Goiter can cause discomfort and affect the function of the thyroid gland.
   - **Hypothyroidism:** A persistent deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism, causing fatigue, weight gain, and other health problems.

   **Most Successful Method for Iodine Deficiency Aversion:**
   The most effective method to avert iodine deficiency in an entire population is iodized salt. By adding iodine to table salt, it becomes a common dietary source of the micronutrient. People can consume iodized salt as part of their daily diet, helping to ensure they meet their iodine requirements.

   **Recommended Daily Iodine Intake for Pregnant Women:**
   - The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that pregnant women in countries without iodine deficiency consume 250 micrograms of iodine daily.
   - In countries with iodine deficiency, pregnant women may need higher doses, and recommendations vary depending on the specific regional situation. In such cases, supplementation may be necessary to meet the increased requirements during pregnancy.

2. **WHO Definition of Health:**
   The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." This definition emphasizes that health is more than just the absence of illness; it encompasses a holistic state of well-being that includes physical, mental, and social aspects. In other words, a healthy individual is not just someone who is free from diseases but someone who enjoys overall well-being and quality of life.

3. **Some Diseases That Should Be Recognized by Everyone:**
   While there are numerous diseases, some are particularly important to recognize due to their prevalence, severity, or impact on public health. These include:

   - **Heart Disease:** Heart diseases, including coronary artery disease and heart attacks, are leading causes of death worldwide.
   - **Cancer:** Various forms of cancer, such as lung, breast, and colorectal cancer, are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.
   - **Diabetes:** Diabetes mellitus, both type 1 and type 2, affects millions of people and can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.
   - **HIV/AIDS:** Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) remain global health concerns.
   - **Respiratory Diseases:** Conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia contribute to significant health burdens.
   - **Infectious Diseases:** Diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, and COVID-19 are infectious diseases that can have widespread implications for public health.

   Recognizing these diseases is important for prevention, early detection, and appropriate management to improve health outcomes and reduce their impact on individuals and society. Public awareness, vaccination, healthy lifestyle choices, and regular medical check-ups play crucial roles in addressing these health challenges.
