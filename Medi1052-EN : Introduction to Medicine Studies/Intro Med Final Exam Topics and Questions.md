31. **Main Noncommunicable Diseases Influenced by Nutrition:** Heart disease, obesity, and diabetes can be influenced by balanced nutrition from early childhood.

32. **Iodine Supplements for Pregnant Women in Countries without Deficiency:** Yes, it's recommended to ensure adequate iodine intake for both mother and fetus.

37. **Effect of Zinc Deficiency in Pregnant Vegans on Child Development:** Zinc deficiency in pregnancy might impact the child's growth and cognitive development.

38. **IGF (Insulin-like Growth Factor) and Its Role with Zinc:** IGF works in conjunction with zinc in cellular growth and metabolism.

39. **Response of Pancreas and Body to Simple Sugars:** They cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels compared to complex sugars, leading to increased insulin release.

40. **Blood Pressure Considered Risky for Young Adults:** Elevated blood pressure, particularly values higher than 130/80 mmHg, poses an increased risk.
