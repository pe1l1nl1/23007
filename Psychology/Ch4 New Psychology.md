**Slide 2: Carl Stumpf (1848–1936)**
- Carl Stumpf, born in Bavaria, had a remarkable early interest in both science and music.
- He excelled in music, mastering multiple instruments and composing music from a very young age.
- His academic journey led him to the University of Würzburg, where he initially pursued science but eventually focused on philosophy.
- In 1868, he earned his doctoral degree, marking the beginning of his academic career.

**Slide 3: Stumpf's Influence**
- Stumpf's career reached its pinnacle when he was awarded the most esteemed professorship in German psychology at the University of Berlin in 1894.
- He transformed a small laboratory into a major institute in Berlin.
- Stumpf is recognized as a significant rival to Wilhelm Wundt, another influential psychologist.
- Notably, two of his students would go on to found the Gestalt psychology movement.

**Slide 4: Phenomenology**
- Stumpf's approach to psychology was grounded in phenomenology.
- Phenomenology is about observing unbiased experience exactly as it happens, without breaking it down into elements.
- This was a point of disagreement with Wilhelm Wundt, who preferred a more reductionist approach.
- Importantly, Stumpf's work laid the groundwork for the later philosophy of phenomenology by Edmund Husserl.

**Slide 5: Stumpf and Wundt's Bitter Debate**
- Stumpf and Wundt engaged in a heated debate over introspection, particularly regarding tones.
- The dispute centered on whose introspection reports were more reliable: Wundt's highly trained laboratory observers or Stumpf's expert musicians.
- Stumpf staunchly rejected Wundt's findings, highlighting the credibility of his own introspection reports.

**Slide 6: Contributions Beyond Psychology**
- Stumpf's contributions extended beyond psychology.
- He established a center for collecting primitive music recordings, reflecting his lifelong passion for music.
- Stumpf's influence also led to the founding of the Berlin Association for Child Psychology.
- His theory linking feelings to sensations remains relevant to contemporary cognitive theories of emotion.

**Slide 7: Oswald Külpe (1862–1915)**
- Oswald Külpe initially followed the path set by Wundt but eventually challenged it.
- He began his academic journey at the University of Leipzig, planning to study history but switching to philosophy and experimental psychology under Wundt's influence.
- Külpe's dedication of his textbook to Wundt highlights their initial alignment.
- In 1894, Külpe accepted a professorship at the University of Würzburg.

**Slide 8: Differences with Wundt**
- Initially, Külpe shared Wundt's belief that studying higher mental processes was impractical.
- However, he later believed that thought processes could indeed be studied experimentally, challenging Wundt's perspective.
- Külpe introduced the concept of systematic experimental introspection, differing from Wundt's focus on studying conscious experience as it occurred.

**Slide 9: Systematic Experimental Introspection**
- Külpe's method involved complex tasks followed by retrospective reports.
- Subjects described their cognitive processes after performing a task.
- This approach contrasted with Wundt's objection to retrospective reporting.
- Külpe's emphasis was on detailed, subjective, and qualitative reports.

**Slide 10: Imageless Thought**
- Külpe's research introduced the concept of imageless thought, suggesting that thought could occur without sensory or imaginal content.
- This challenged the prevailing idea that all experience consisted of sensations and images.
- Imageless thought was proposed independently by other psychologists, including Robert Woodworth and Alfred Binet.

**Slide 11: Research Topics at Würzburg**
- Külpe and his students explored a range of topics.
- Karl Marbe's study on the judgment of weights challenged the role of sensations and images in conscious experience.
- Henry Watt's word-association task revealed unconscious influences on conscious behavior.

**Slide 12: Conclusion**
- In summary, Carl Stumpf and Oswald Külpe made significant contributions to psychology.
- Their emphasis on phenomenology and systematic introspection expanded the field's horizons.
- Their work paved the way for the development of Gestalt psychology and the study of unconscious processes.

**Slide 13: Q&A**
- Thank you for your attention. We're now open to any questions you may have.

**Slide 1: Introduction**

- Today, we delve into the lives and contributions of two influential figures in the history of psychology: Carl Stumpf and Oswald Külpe.
- We will explore their backgrounds, key ideas, and their impact on the field.

**Slide 2: Carl Stumpf (1848–1936)**
- Born into a medical family in Bavaria.
- Early interest in science and music; mastered multiple instruments.
- Studied philosophy and science at the University of Würzburg.
- Received his doctoral degree in 1868.
- Awarded a prestigious professorship in German psychology at the University of Berlin in 1894.

**Slide 3: Stumpf's Influence**
- Developed a significant psychology institute in Berlin.
- Considered a major rival of Wilhelm Wundt.
- Trained psychologists who later founded Gestalt psychology.
- His work in the psychology of tone and music was pioneering.

**Slide 4: Phenomenology**
- Stumpf's approach emphasized phenomenology.
- Phenomenology involves the examination of unbiased experience as it occurs.
- Disagree with Wundt's reduction of experience into elements.
- Influenced Edmund Husserl's philosophy of phenomenology.

**Slide 5: Stumpf and Wundt's Bitter Debate**
- Engaged in a fierce debate about introspection of tones.
- Wundt's laboratory observers vs. Stumpf's expert musicians.
- Stumpf refused to accept Wundt's results.
- Highlighted the credibility of introspection reports.

**Slide 6: Contributions Beyond Psychology**
- Established a centre for collecting primitive music recordings.
- Founded the Berlin Association for Child Psychology.
- Published a theory linking feelings to sensations.
- Expanded psychology's boundaries independently of Wundt.

**Slide 7: Oswald Külpe (1862–1915)**
- Initially followed Wundt's path but later challenged it.
- Studied at the University of Leipzig under Wundt's influence.
- Dedicated his textbook "Outline of Psychology" to Wundt.
- Accepted a professorship at the University of Würzburg in 1894.
  
**Slide 8: Differences with Wundt**
- Initially, Külpe aligned with Wundt's limitations on studying higher mental processes.
- Later, he believed that thought processes could be studied experimentally.
- Introduced systematic experimental introspection.
- Contrasted with Wundt's approach of studying conscious experience as it occurred.
