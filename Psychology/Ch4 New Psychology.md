# Slide 1: Introduction

Today, we delve into the lives and contributions of two influential figures in the history of psychology: Carl Stumpf and Oswald Külpe.
We will explore their backgrounds, key ideas, and their impact on the field.
# Slide 2: Carl Stumpf (1848–1936)

Born into a medical family in Bavaria.
Early interest in science and music; mastered multiple instruments.
Studied philosophy and science at the University of Würzburg.
Received his doctoral degree in 1868.
Awarded a prestigious professorship in German psychology at the University of Berlin in 1894.
# Slide 3: Stumpf's Influence

Developed a significant psychology institute in Berlin.
Considered a major rival of Wilhelm Wundt.
Trained psychologists who later founded Gestalt psychology.
His work in the psychology of tone and music was pioneering.
# Slide 4: Phenomenology

Stumpf's approach emphasized phenomenology.
Phenomenology involves the examination of unbiased experience as it occurs.
Disagreed with Wundt's reduction of experience into elements.
Influenced Edmund Husserl's philosophy of phenomenology.
# Slide 5: Stumpf and Wundt's Bitter Debate

Engaged in a fierce debate about introspection of tones.
Wundt's laboratory observers vs. Stumpf's expert musicians.
Stumpf refused to accept Wundt's results.
Highlighted the credibility of introspection reports.
# Slide 6: Contributions Beyond Psychology

Established a center for collecting primitive music recordings.
Founded the Berlin Association for Child Psychology.
Published a theory linking feelings to sensations.
Expanded psychology's boundaries independently of Wundt.
# Slide 7: Oswald Külpe (1862–1915)

Initially followed Wundt's path but later challenged it.
Studied at the University of Leipzig under Wundt's influence.
Dedicated his textbook "Outline of Psychology" to Wundt.
Accepted a professorship at the University of Würzburg in 1894.
# Slide 8: Differences with Wundt

Initially, Külpe aligned with Wundt's limitations on studying higher mental processes.
Later, he believed that thought processes could be studied experimentally.
Introduced systematic experimental introspection.
Contrasted with Wundt's approach of studying conscious experience as it occurred.
# Slide 9: Systematic Experimental Introspection

Külpe's method involved complex tasks followed by retrospective reports.
Subjects described their cognitive processes after performing a task.
Contrasted with Wundt's objection to retrospective reporting.
Emphasized detailed, subjective, qualitative reports.
# Slide 10: Imageless Thought

Külpe's research introduced the concept of imageless thought.
Thought could occur without sensory or imaginal content.
Supported by studies challenging the idea that all experience consists of sensations and images.
# Slide 11: Research Topics at Würzburg

Külpe and his students explored various topics.
Karl Marbe's study on the judgment of weights challenged the role of sensations and images.
Henry Watt's word-association task revealed unconscious influences on conscious behavior.
# Slide 12: Conclusion

Carl Stumpf and Oswald Külpe made significant contributions to psychology.
Their emphasis on phenomenology and systematic introspection expanded the field's horizons.
Their work paved the way for the development of Gestalt psychology and the study of unconscious processes.
