Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Today, we'll explore a fascinating aspect of human existence - our sleep patterns and the profound influence that culture and society have on them. Sleep isn't just about biology; it's a dynamic interplay of cultural norms, social practices, and individual choices. In this presentation, we'll unravel the intricate connections between our cultural and social environments and the quality of our sleep.

Why is this important?
Sleep is a universal need, but how we sleep can be profoundly shaped by our cultural and social contexts. Understanding these influences is crucial for promoting better sleep health and overall well-being.
Our Journey Today
Together, we will:
Examine cultural variations in sleep practices
Investigate the impact of societal expectations
