# Joints of the lower limb

## Hip Joint 

The Hip Joint: a ball and socket synovial joint, formed by an articulation between the pelvic acetabulum and the head of the femur. 

It forms a connection from the lower limb to the pelvic girdle - and is designed for stability and **weight-bearing**.

### Articulating surfaces
It consists of an articulation between the femur head and the acetabulum of the pelvis. 

- Acetabulum - a cup-like depression located on the inferolateral aspect of the pelvis. Its cavity is deepened by the presence of a fibrocartilaginous collar - the acetabular labrum.
- The head of the femur is hemispherical and fits completely into the concavity of the acetabulum.
- Both the acetabulum and head of the femur are covered in articular cartilage, which is thicker at places at places of weight bearing.
- The capsule of the hip joint attaches to the edge of the acetabulum proximally.
- Distally, it attaches to the intertrochanteric line anteriorly and the femoral neck posteriorly.

### The ligaments of the hip joint act to increase stability 

**Intracapsular**: the ligament of the head of the femur-   a relatively small structure, which runs from the acetabular fossa to the fovea of the femur. It encloses a branch of the obturator artery (artery to head of the femur), a minor source of arterial supply to the hip joint. 

**Extracapsular** continuous with the outer surface of the hip joint capsule:
- **Iliofemoral ligament** arises form the anterior iliac spine and bifurcates before inserting into the intertrochanteric femur line. It has a "Y" shaped appearance and prevents hyperextension of the hip joint. It is the strongest of the three ligaments.
- **Pubofemoral** - spans between the superior pubic rami and the intertrochanteric line of the femur, reinforcing the capsule anteriorly and inferiorly, triangular shape, prevents excessive abduction and extension.
- **Ischiofemoral** -spans between the body of the ischium and the greater trochanter of the femur, prevents hyperextension and holds the femoral head in the acetabulum.

### Stabilising Factors 
**Acetabulum** It is deep and encompasses nearly all of the head of the femur. This decreases the probability of the head dislocating out of the acetabulum. 
**Acetabular labrum** is a horseshow-shaped fibrocartilaginous ring around the acetabulum which increases its depth - and provides a larger articular surface, further improving the stability of the joint. 

The iliofemoral, pubofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments are very strong, and along with the thickened joint capsule, provide a large degree of stability. These ligaments have a unique spiral orientation; this causes them to become tighter when the joint is extended. 

- **Anteriorly,** where the ligaments are strongest, the medial flexor (located anteriorly) are fewer and weaker.
- **Posteriorly** where the ligaments are weakest, the medial rotators are greater in number and stronger - they effectively "pull" the head of the femur into the acetabulum.

**Movements**
**Flexion** - Iliopsoas, rectus femoris, sartorius, pectineus. The degree to which flexion at the hip can occur depends on whether the knee is flexed - this relaxes the hamstring muscles and increases the range of flexion.
**Extension** - gluteus maximus; semimembranosus, semitendinpsus, and biceps femoris (the hamstrings). Extension at the hip joint is limited by the joint capsule and the iliofemoral ligament. These structures become taut during extension to limit further movement. 
**Abduction** -gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, piriformis and tensor fascia latae
**Adduction** - adductors longus, brevis and magnus, prectineus and gracilis 
**Lateral Rotation** biceps femoris gluteus maximus, piriformis, assisted by the obturators, gemili and quadratus femoris.
**Medial Rotation** anterior fibres of gluteus medius and minimus, tensor fascia latae

### The Knee Joint 
The knee joint is a hinge-type synovial joint, which mainly allows for flexion and extension ( and a small degree of medial and lateral rotation). It is formed by articulations between the patella, femur, and tibia.
