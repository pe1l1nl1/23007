# Joints of the lower limb

## Hip Joint 

The Hip Joint: a ball and socket synovial joint, formed by an articulation between the pelvic acetabulum and the head of the femur. 

It forms a connection from the lower limb to the pelvic girdle - and is designed for stability and **weight-bearing**.

### Articulating surfaces
It consists of an articulation between the femur head and the acetabulum of the pelvis. 

- Acetabulum - a cup-like depression located on the inferolateral aspect of the pelvis. Its cavity is deepened by the presence of a fibrocartilaginous collar - the acetabular labrum.
- The head of the femur is hemispherical and fits completely into the concavity of the acetabulum.
- Both the acetabulum and head of the femur are covered in articular cartilage, which is thicker at places at places of weight bearing.
- The capsule of the hip joint attaches to the edge of the acetabulum proximally.
- Distally, it attaches to the intertrochanteric line anteriorly and the femoral neck posteriorly.

### The ligaments of the hip joint act to increase stability 

**Intracapsular**: the ligament of the head of the femur-   a relatively small structure, which runs from the acetabular fossa to the fovea of the femur. It encloses a branch of the obturator artery (artery to head of the femur), a minor source of arterial supply to the hip joint. 

**Extracapsular** continuous with the outer surface of the hip joint capsule:
- **Iliofemoral ligament** arises form the anterior iliac spine and bifurcates before inserting into the intertrochanteric femur line. It has a "Y" shaped appearance and prevents hyperextension of the hip joint. It is the strongest of the three ligaments.
- **Pubofemoral** - spans between the superior pubic rami and the intertrochanteric line of the femur, reinforcing the capsule anteriorly and inferiorly, triangular shape, prevents excessive abduction and extension.
- **Ischiofemoral** -spans between the body of the ischium and the greater trochanter of the femur, prevents hyperextension and holds the femoral head in the acetabulum.

### Stabilising Factors 
**Acetabulum** It is deep and encompasses nearly all of the head of the femur. This decreases the probability of the head dislocating out of the acetabulum. 
**Acetabular labrum** is a horseshow-shaped fibrocartilaginous ring around the acetabulum which increases its depth - and provides a larger articular surface, further improving the stability of the joint. 

The iliofemoral, pubofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments are very strong, and along with the thickened joint capsule, provide a large degree of stability. These ligaments have a unique spiral orientation; this causes them to become tighter when the joint is extended. 

- **Anteriorly,** where the ligaments are strongest, the medial flexor (located anteriorly) are fewer and weaker.
- **Posteriorly** where the ligaments are weakest, the medial rotators are greater in number and stronger - they effectively "pull" the head of the femur into the acetabulum.

**Movements**
**Flexion** - Iliopsoas, rectus femoris, sartorius, pectineus. The degree to which flexion at the hip can occur depends on whether the knee is flexed - this relaxes the hamstring muscles and increases the range of flexion.
**Extension** - gluteus maximus; semimembranosus, semitendinpsus, and biceps femoris (the hamstrings). Extension at the hip joint is limited by the joint capsule and the iliofemoral ligament. These structures become taut during extension to limit further movement. 
**Abduction** -gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, piriformis and tensor fascia latae
**Adduction** - adductors longus, brevis and magnus, prectineus and gracilis 
**Lateral Rotation** biceps femoris gluteus maximus, piriformis, assisted by the obturators, gemili and quadratus femoris.
**Medial Rotation** anterior fibres of gluteus medius and minimus, tensor fascia latae

### The Knee Joint 
The knee joint is a hinge-type synovial joint, which mainly allows for flexion and extension ( and a small degree of medial and lateral rotation). It is formed by articulations between the patella, femur, and tibia. 

**Tibiofemoral** - medial and lateral condyles of the femur articulating with the tibial condyles

**Patellofemoral** -anterior aspect of the distal femur articulating with the patella

The tibiofemoral joint - the **weight-bearing** joint of the knee
The patellofemoral joint - allows the tendon of the **quadriceps femoris** (the main extensor of the knee) to be inserted directly over the knee, increasing muscle efficiency.

As the patella is both formed and resides within the quadriceps femoris tendon, it provides a fulcrum to increase the power of the knee extensor and serves as a stabilising structure that reduces frictional forces placed on femoral condyles. 

Both joint surfaces are lined with hyaline cartilage and enclosed within a single joint cavity.

The medial and lateral menisci are fibrocartilage structures in the knee that serve two functions: 

- to deepen the articular surface of the tibia, thus increasing the stability of the joint.
- to act as shock absorbers by increasing surface area to further dissipate forces

They are C-shaped, and attached at both ends to the **intercondylar** area of the tibia. 

In addition to the intercondylar attachment, the **medial meniscus** is fixed to the tibial collateral ligament and the joint capsule. Damage to the tibial collateral ligament usually results in a medial meniscal tear. 

The **lateral meniscus** is smaller and does not have any extra attachments, rendering it fairly mobile. 

A bursa is a synovial fluid-filled sac, found between moving structures in a joint - with the aim of reducing wear and tear on those structures. There are four bursae found in the knee joint.

- **Suprapatella bursa**  This is an extension of the synovial cavity of the knee, located between the quadriceps femoris and the femur
- **Prepatella bursa** Found between the apex of the patella and the skin
- **Infrapatella bursa** Split into deep and superficial. The deep bursa lies between the tibia and the patella ligament. The superficial lies between the patella ligament and the skin.
- **Semimembranosus bursa** located posteriorly in the knee joint, between the semimembranosus muscle and the medial head of the gastrocnemius.

The major ligaments in the knee joint are: 

- **Patellar ligament** - a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon distal to the patella. It attaches to the tibial tuberosity. 
- **Collateral ligaments** – two strap-like ligaments. They act to stabilise the hinge motion of the knee, preventing excessive medial or lateral movement.
- Tibial (medial) collateral ligament
-  A wide and flat ligament, found    on the medial side of the joint. Proximally, it attaches to the medial epicondyle of the femur, distally it attaches to the medial condyle of the tibia. Fibular (lateral) collateral ligament
- Thinner and rounder than the tibial collateral, this attaches proximally to the lateral epicondyle of the femur, distally it attaches to a depression on the lateral surface of the fibular head.
- **Cruciate Ligaments** – These two ligaments connect the femur and the tibia. In doing so, they cross each other, hence the term ‘cruciate’ (Latin for like a cross)
- Anterior cruciate ligament - it attaches at the anterior intercondylar  region of the tibia where it blends with the medial meniscus. It        ascends posteriorly to attach to the femur in the intercondylar fossa. It prevents anterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur.
- Posterior cruciate ligament - attaches at the posterior intercondylar region of the tibia, and ascends anteriorly to attach to the anteromedial femoral condyle. It prevents posterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur.

There are four main movements that the knee joint permits: 

- **Extension** produced by the quadriceps femoris, which inserts into the tibial tuberosity.
- **Flexion** produced by the hamstrings, gracilis, sartorius and popliteus.
- **Lateral rotation** produced by the biceps femoris
- **Medial rotation** produced by five muscles; semimembranosus, semitendinosus, gracilis, sartorius, and popliteus

NB: Lateral and medial rotation can only occur when the knee is flexed (if the knee is not flexed, the medial/lateral rotation occurs at the hip joint) 

The ankle joint (or **talocrural joint**) is a synovial joint located in the lower limb. It is formed by the bones of the leg (tibia and fibula) and the foot (talus). Functionally, it is a **hinge-type** joint, permitting dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot.

The ankle joint is formed by the 3 bones: the tibia, the fibula of the leg and the talus of the foot.

The tibia and fibular are bound together by strong **tibiofibular ligaments**. Together, they form a bracket-shaped socket, covered in hyaline cartilage. This socket is known as a mortise.

The **body of the talus** fits snugly into the mortise formed by the bones of the leg. The articulating part of the talus is wedge-shaped - it is broad anteriorly, and narrow posteriorly:

- Dorsiflexion - the anterior part of the talus is held in the mortise, and the joint is more stable.
- Plantarflexion - the posterior part of the talus is held in the mortise, and the joint is less stable.

The **medial ligament** or deltoid ligament is attached to the medial malleolus ( a bony prominence projecting from the medial aspect of the distal tibia). It consists of four ligaments, which fan out from the malleolus, attaching to the talus, calcaneus and navicular bones. The primary action of the medial is to resist **over-eversion** of the foot. 

The **lateral ligament** originates from the lateral malleolus ( a bony prominence projecting from the lateral aspect of the distal fibula). It resists over-inversion of the foot, and is comprised of three distinct and separate ligaments:

- **Anterior talofibular** - spans between the lateral malleolus and lateral aspect of the talus.
- **Posterior talofibular** - spans between the lateral malleolus and the posterior aspect of the talus.
- **Calcaneofibular** - spans between the lateral malleolus and the calcaneus.

The ankle joint is a hinge-type joint, with movement permitted in one plane. 

Thus, plantarflexion and dorsiflexion are the main movements that occur at the ankle joint. Eversion and inversion are produced at the other joints of the foot, such as the subtalar joint. 

- Plantarflexion - produced by the muscle in the posterior compartment of the leg (gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris and posterior tibialis).
- Dorsiflexion produced by the muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg (tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus)

The **proximal** and **distal tibiofibular joints** refer to two articulations between the tibia and fibula of the leg. These joints have a minimal function in terms of movement but play a greater role in stability and weight-bearing.

The proximal tibiofibular joint is formed by an articulation between the head of the fibula and the lateral condyle of the tibia. 

It is a type of synovial joint; where the bones glide over one another to create movement.

The articular surfaces of the proximal tibiofibular joint are lined with hyaline cartilage and contained within a joint capsule. 

The joint capsule receives additional support from: 

- **Anterior and posterior superior tibiofibular ligaments** - span between the fibular head and lateral tibial condyle.
- **Lateral collateral ligament of the knee joint**
- **Biceps femoris** provides reinforcement as it inserts onto the fibular head

The **distal (inferior) tibiofibular joint** consists of an articulation between the fibular notch of the distal tibia and the fibula.

It is an example of a fibrous joint, where the joint surfaces are by bound by tough, fibrous tissue. 

The distal tibiofibular joint is supported by:

- **Interosseous membrane** - a fibrous structure spanning the length of the tibia and fibula
- **Lateral collateral ligament of the knee joint**
- **Biceps femoris** - provides reinforcement as it inserts onto the fibular head

As it is a fibrous joint, the distal tibiofibular joint does not have a joint capsule (only synovial joints have a joint capsule).

The subtalar joint is an articulation between two of the tarsal bones in the foot - the talus and calcaneus. The joint is classed structurally as a synovial and functionally as a plane.  The joint is classed structurally as a synovial and functionally as a plane, these surfaces are covered by articular cartilage. The subtalar joint is formed between two of the tarsal bones: 

- Inferior surface of the body of the talus - the posterior talar articular surface
- Superior surface of the calcaneus - the posterior calcaneal articular facet

<img width="442" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-29 at 19 17 15" src="https://github.com/pe1l1nl1/23007/assets/19546253/632e842a-a754-4f48-bb49-41d96f6b2774">


The subtalar joint is enclosed by a joint capsule, which is lined internally by a synovial membrane and strengthened externally by a fibrous layer. The capsule is also supported by three ligaments.

- Posterior talocalcaneal ligament
- Medial talocalcaneal ligament
- Lateral talocalcaneal

sinus tarsi (a small cavity between the talus and calcaneus) 
interosseous talocalcaneal ligament  - acts to bind the talus and calcaneus together. It lies within the sinus tarsi, and is particularly strong; providing the majority of the ligamentous stability to the joint. 

The subtalar joint is formed on an **oblique axis** foot generation site of **eversion and inversion**. This movement is produced by the **muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg** and the **tibialis anterior muscle** respectively. The nature of the articulating surface means that the subtalar joint has no role in the plantar or dorsiflexion of the foot.
