# Assessment 1. Read and Present a Scientific Paper in the Class 

For this seminar, you have to find and read one research study (scientific article) on stigmatisation in the context of a particular disease or disability.  Please, prepare a written summary (at least 300 words) of this study and take it with you for the seminar. During the seminar, your task will be to inform your classmates about the study.  You have to submit your summary before the seminar here in the e-studies.

You can find scientific articles in various internet databases such as Pubmed or Google Scholar. Note that in many cases full text can be accessed through the LU library, by using PRIMO. If the scientific article is long, you can read a specific part of the study, which analyses stigmatisation, but this part of the text must be at least 6 pages long.

Examples of the scientific articles (these are just examples, you should find one by yourself):
