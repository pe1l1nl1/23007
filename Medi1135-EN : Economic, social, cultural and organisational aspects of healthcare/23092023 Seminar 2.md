# Assessment 1. Read and Present a Scientific Paper in the Class 

For this seminar, you have to find and read one research study (scientific article) on stigmatisation in the context of a particular disease or disability.  Please, prepare a written summary (at least 300 words) of this study and take it with you for the seminar. During the seminar, your task will be to inform your classmates about the study.  You have to submit your summary before the seminar here in the e-studies.

You can find scientific articles in various internet databases such as Pubmed or Google Scholar. Note that in many cases full text can be accessed through the LU library, by using PRIMO. If the scientific article is long, you can read a specific part of the study, which analyses stigmatisation, but this part of the text must be at least 6 pages long.

Examples of the scientific articles (these are just examples, you should find one by yourself):

## Paper 

Murray R, Turner L. Using Communities of Practice Theory to Understand the Crisis of Identity in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Chronic Illness. 2023;19(1):56-64. doi:10.1177/17423953211064989


Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), is a debilitating chronic illness characterized by severe fatigue that lasts for at least 6 months. Alongside fatigue, individuals with CFS/ME experience a range of symptoms, including muscle pain, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, and more. The severity of CFS/ME varies, but it often prevents individuals from maintaining their daily roles. Despite its prevalence, particularly among women, CFS/ME remains a controversial and poorly understood condition.

The history of CFS/ME is fraught with skepticism and disbelief, partly due to a lack of clear biomedical evidence. In the past, it was classified as a neurological disorder, but it was later reclassified as a mental and behavioral disorder, contributing to the controversy surrounding the illness. The lack of support in primary care compounds the challenges faced by those with CFS/ME, as there is currently no cure for the condition.

This paper explores the impact of CFS/ME on individuals' identities, drawing from Communities of Practice (CoP) theory, which examines how participation in various communities shapes one's identity. CoP theory emphasizes that identity is not only an individual experience but also a collective one, influenced by the communities to which a person belongs. 

Participation in communities is crucial for identity development, but chronic illness, such as CFS/ME, disrupts this participation, leading to a loss of established communities and identities. Participants in the study described the profound shift in their lives from being active and engaged to becoming passive and unable to sustain their previous roles. This loss of identity is compounded by the disruption of future plans and aspirations.

Skepticism and disbelief from medical professionals and even family members further compound the challenges faced by those with CFS/ME. The medical community's failure to legitimize the illness leads to a denial of a "sick identity," which can hinder individuals' ability to seek support and understanding.

However, the study also highlights the role of virtual communities, particularly on platforms like Facebook, in providing support and a sense of belonging to individuals with CFS/ME. These online communities enable participants to share their experiences, find acceptance, and offer support to others. Engagement in these communities can transform participants from outsiders to experts, as they gain a sense of mastery and purpose.

In addition, some participants found new ways to adapt and engage in activities that enriched their lives, despite their illness. This adaptation and re-engagement allowed them to develop new identities that were not solely defined by loss or stigma.

The paper concludes that participation in supportive communities, both virtual and real, is essential for individuals with CFS/ME to navigate the challenges posed by the illness. These communities can provide a platform for mutual support and understanding, potentially leading to a shift in the social perception and medical treatment of CFS/ME.

However, the study acknowledges limitations, such as the potential bias introduced by the insider perspective of the researcher and the reliance on online communities for data collection. Further research is needed to explore how participation can be facilitated in various areas of life to better support individuals with CFS/ME.

**Title: Effectiveness of a structured short intervention against stigmatisation in chronic visible skin diseases: Results of a controlled trial in Future Educators**

**Background**

This chapter discusses the prevalence of chronic visible skin diseases in Germany, including psoriasis, acne, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis, affecting around 10 million people. It highlights the significant psychosocial burden faced by patients, with high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among dermatological outpatients. The concept of stigma in skin diseases is introduced, emphasizing the negative stereotypes, social separation, and discrimination experienced by affected individuals. The focus is on psoriasis due to its visibility, leading to misconceptions and stigmatizing attitudes in the general public. Internalized stigma and its adverse effects on quality of life and mental health in psoriasis patients are discussed. The chapter underscores the need for awareness, acceptance, and interventions to reduce stigmatization of skin diseases, particularly psoriasis, as recommended by the World Health Organization. The study aims to evaluate a short intervention targeting preschool teachers in training to reduce stigmatizing attitudes and assess participant satisfaction for future improvements.

**Objectives**
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured short intervention in reducing stigmatising attitudes towards psoriasis in future educators.

**Methods**

The study involved 221 students in vocational training as educators in Kiel, Germany. The research program incorporated input from various professions, patient advocate groups, and patients with psoriasis. The intervention consisted of four components: (1) self‐reflection, (2) education on skin diseases, (3) contact between participants and a person with psoriasis and (4) practising of knowledge via case studies. A quasi‐experimental, pre–post-study design was chosen with a nonrandomized contemporaneous control group that attended regular lessons. Statistical analyses involved t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, χ² tests, repeated-measures ANOVA, and regression analyses, with a significance threshold of p < .05. The main outcomes were participants' desire for social distance, stereotype endorsement, illness‐related misconceptions and intended behaviour. Intervention effects were analysed using mixed repeated‐measures analysis of variance, with Bonferroni post‐hoc tests for pairwise comparisons. 

**Results**

In the results section, 253 students participated in the study, with 221 students attending vocational training as educators (n = 118 intervention group, n = 103 control group). Both control and intervention groups had similar baseline sociodemographic data and main outcome measures. While no effect of the intervention was found in social distance, small to large effect sizes were observed for intended behaviour (r = .14), illness‐related misconceptions (r = .28) and stereotype endorsement (r = .42).  The primary outcomes focused on stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with psoriasis. Stereotype endorsement decreased significantly over time in both groups, with the intervention group showing lower scores at t1. Social distance desire decreased significantly in the intervention group, while no significant change was observed in the control group. Illness-related misconceptions were reduced in the intervention group, with no significant change in the control group. Intended behaviour improved in the intervention group at t1. Group status, gender, and previous vocational training were predictors of these outcomes. Participants in the intervention group expressed higher satisfaction with the class, with many suggesting more time with the patient and future seminars covering different skin diseases or patients.

**Conclusions**
The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a short intervention in reducing stigmatizing attitudes among future educators, particularly focusing on individuals with psoriasis. The intervention involved education, contact with patients, and discussions about stigmatization. Results showed significant reductions in stigmatizing attitudes, misconceptions, and social distance desire in the intervention group. Although the intended behaviour improved immediately after the intervention, it reverted to baseline levels at follow-up. Overall, the intervention had a positive impact compared to the control group, with larger effects on attitudes and misconceptions. The study suggests the potential benefits of integrating such interventions into educational curricula and underscores the importance of further research in different contexts and over longer durations.
