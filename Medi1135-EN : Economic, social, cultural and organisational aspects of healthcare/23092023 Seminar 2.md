# Assessment 1. Read and Present a Scientific Paper in the Class 

For this seminar, you have to find and read one research study (scientific article) on stigmatisation in the context of a particular disease or disability.  Please, prepare a written summary (at least 300 words) of this study and take it with you for the seminar. During the seminar, your task will be to inform your classmates about the study.  You have to submit your summary before the seminar here in the e-studies.

You can find scientific articles in various internet databases such as Pubmed or Google Scholar. Note that in many cases full text can be accessed through the LU library, by using PRIMO. If the scientific article is long, you can read a specific part of the study, which analyses stigmatisation, but this part of the text must be at least 6 pages long.

Examples of the scientific articles (these are just examples, you should find one by yourself):

## Paper 

Murray R, Turner L. Using Communities of Practice Theory to Understand the Crisis of Identity in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Chronic Illness. 2023;19(1):56-64. doi:10.1177/17423953211064989


Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), is a debilitating chronic illness characterized by severe fatigue that lasts for at least 6 months. Alongside fatigue, individuals with CFS/ME experience a range of symptoms, including muscle pain, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, and more. The severity of CFS/ME varies, but it often prevents individuals from maintaining their daily roles. Despite its prevalence, particularly among women, CFS/ME remains a controversial and poorly understood condition.

The history of CFS/ME is fraught with skepticism and disbelief, partly due to a lack of clear biomedical evidence. In the past, it was classified as a neurological disorder, but it was later reclassified as a mental and behavioral disorder, contributing to the controversy surrounding the illness. The lack of support in primary care compounds the challenges faced by those with CFS/ME, as there is currently no cure for the condition.

This paper explores the impact of CFS/ME on individuals' identities, drawing from Communities of Practice (CoP) theory, which examines how participation in various communities shapes one's identity. CoP theory emphasizes that identity is not only an individual experience but also a collective one, influenced by the communities to which a person belongs. 

Participation in communities is crucial for identity development, but chronic illness, such as CFS/ME, disrupts this participation, leading to a loss of established communities and identities. Participants in the study described the profound shift in their lives from being active and engaged to becoming passive and unable to sustain their previous roles. This loss of identity is compounded by the disruption of future plans and aspirations.

Skepticism and disbelief from medical professionals and even family members further compound the challenges faced by those with CFS/ME. The medical community's failure to legitimize the illness leads to a denial of a "sick identity," which can hinder individuals' ability to seek support and understanding.

However, the study also highlights the role of virtual communities, particularly on platforms like Facebook, in providing support and a sense of belonging to individuals with CFS/ME. These online communities enable participants to share their experiences, find acceptance, and offer support to others. Engagement in these communities can transform participants from outsiders to experts, as they gain a sense of mastery and purpose.

In addition, some participants found new ways to adapt and engage in activities that enriched their lives, despite their illness. This adaptation and re-engagement allowed them to develop new identities that were not solely defined by loss or stigma.

The paper concludes that participation in supportive communities, both virtual and real, is essential for individuals with CFS/ME to navigate the challenges posed by the illness. These communities can provide a platform for mutual support and understanding, potentially leading to a shift in the social perception and medical treatment of CFS/ME.

However, the study acknowledges limitations, such as the potential bias introduced by the insider perspective of the researcher and the reliance on online communities for data collection. Further research is needed to explore how participation can be facilitated in various areas of life to better support individuals with CFS/ME.
