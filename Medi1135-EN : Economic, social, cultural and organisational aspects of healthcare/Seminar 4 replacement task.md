If you have missed the class, then you have to watch the video "Justine Chitsena's Story" (https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/HM836+Justines-story/1_63pxy8l5) and answer the following questions (in at least 300 words):

1) What are the grandmother’s beliefs about the illness itself and the surgery? How do they differ from the medical perspective? What is Bouphet Chitsena’s perspective, and how is it different from both of the others?

Grandma believes that the procedure might harm her grandchild in this life and leave a lasting spiritual wound into the next. In line with her beliefs, she doesn't see any positive outcome from it. Pediatric nurse Dru Foote, on the other hand, explains that the surgery is necessary to heal the child and prevent cardiac issues.

Grandmother perceives the procedure as more of a disfiguring intervention, fearing that the child will bear the consequences indefinitely. She intends to seek an alternative approach by conducting a Soo-Kwon ceremony to invoke the spirits of the ancestors in hopes of healing Justine.

Bouphet Chitsena, Justine's mother, respects her grandmother's wishes and plans to proceed with the ceremony. Afterwards, they will consider consulting a paediatrician to assess whether any remarkable improvements have occurred. If not, they will heed the doctor's advice and proceed with the surgery.

3) How would you explore Bouphet Chitsena’s (or her mother’s) beliefs and perspectives about the atrial septal defect and the operation?

Grandmother believes that having a shorter life is preferable to bearing scars or spiritual wounds that might affect the next life or persist indefinitely. On the other hand, Justine's mother is more willing to consider the medical procedure, but she's apprehensive about potentially conflicting with her family's beliefs and values.

5) How does the decision-making happen in this family (vs. most American families)? What is Justine’s grandmother’s role? What is her mother’s role?


This family's decision-making process reflects a traditional hierarchy, with the elderly members taking on a central role in making important decisions, which others then follow. In this particular case, the child's grandmother's opinions are adhered to rigorously, and her mother primarily aligns with the grandmother's beliefs. The mother, however, seems to have a more balanced perspective, placing a greater emphasis on the child's current well-being. The grandmother's stance is rooted in their belief system, emphasizing that the child's life would be better without any scars or wounds.

This contrasts with the decision-making process typically observed in American families, where both parents usually engage in discussions with the doctor and share decision-making responsibilities. In this family, it appears that the men's roles are not as prominent or clearly defined in this specific situation.

5) What was your impression of the negotiation that took place between the family and the medical staff? What did you think was appropriate/effective in the staff’s approach? What would you have done differently?


Indeed, the decision-making process in this situation appears to involve a combination of persuasion and negotiation. The healthcare professionals are making efforts to convince the child's family of the necessity of the surgery while also presenting alternative procedures that would result in fewer scars and fewer side effects. They emphasize the importance of the surgery to prevent further health issues.

This approach seems effective as it allows the family to explore methods that may heal the child in different ways, aligning with their beliefs and values, while also providing a scientific method to verify the results. In cases where the situation is not urgent and the family's belief system is not causing harm to the child, this approach can strike a balance between respecting cultural values and ensuring the child's well-being. It's a method that respects the family's autonomy while safeguarding the child's health.
