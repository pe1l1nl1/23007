### Assessment 2 6.11

Describe some positive and some negative aspects of each of the payment schemes:
- For patient
- For health care provider

1. Fee for service
   - From the patient's perspective, accessing needed services may be challenging, with no apparent benefits.
   - For healthcare providers, they receive fair compensation, but the downside is that these fees might be unaffordable for some individuals in need.

3. Fixed salary
   - Patients must be employed to access healthcare services, but this approach doesn't accommodate those who are unemployed.
   - Healthcare providers lack incentives to work harder or more, potentially limiting their motivation, but it ensures a lack of corruption in the system.

5. Capitation payment
   - Capitation payment involves healthcare providers receiving a set fee per patient, offering stability in income.
   - However, this method can lead to concerns about overburdening healthcare professionals if the number of patients exceeds their capacity.
