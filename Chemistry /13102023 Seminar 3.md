## Oxidation and reduction processes, coordination compounds

1. Determine the oxidation state of each element: 
- KOH;
- H2SO4;
- I2O5;
- MnO4-;
- Cr2(SO3)3;
- CrO4 2-


<details> <summary> <h3>General Rules for Assigning Oxidation States</h3></summary> 

- For monoatomic ions (ions consisting of a single atom), the oxidation state is equal to the charge of the ion. For example, in KOH, K has an oxidation state of +1, and O and H have oxidation states of -2 and +1, respectively.

- In a compound, the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms must equal the overall charge of the compound.

- Hydrogen (H) typically has an oxidation state of +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals. However, there are exceptions.

- Oxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2 in compounds. However, there are exceptions, such as in peroxides where it has an oxidation state of -1.

- The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a polyatomic ion must equal the charge of the ion. For example, in the sulfate ion (SO4^2-), the sum of the oxidation states of S and O must equal -2.

Using Postulated Oxidation Number Rules
In many cases where you need to calculate the oxidation state, you'll be dealing with atoms earlier in the periodic table. In these cases, you can usually find the oxidation numbers for all or most atoms in a molecule using the following set of rules:

1. The oxidation number of any atom in its elemental form is 0.
2. The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a monatomic ion is equal to the overall charge of that ion.
3. The oxidation number of fluorine is always -1. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine usually have an oxidation number of -1, unless they're combined with oxygen or fluorine.
4. The oxidation number of a Group 1 element in a compound is +1. The alkali metals (group I) always have an oxidation number of +1.
5. The oxidation number of a Group 2 element in a compound is +2. The alkaline earth metals (group II) are always assigned an oxidation number of +2.
6. Oxygen almost always has an oxidation number of -2, except in:
   6.1 peroxides (e.g. H2O2) where it is -1
   6.2 compounds with fluorine (e.g. OF2) where it is +2
7. The oxidation number of H is +1 when combined with more electronegative elements (e.g. non-metals) it is -1 when combined with less electronegative elements (e.g. metals).

   - d) In3+ → In+

My answers:
```text 
   - Fe2+ --> Fe3+ + e-
   - Oxidation Fe2+ loses an electron (e-)
   - Al3+ + 3e- -> Al
   - Reduction where Al3+ gains 3 electrons.
   - N3- + 3 e- -> N2
   - Reduction N3- gains 3 electrons
   - In3 + 3 e- -> In+
   - Reduction In3 gains 3 electrons.

    -  name the coordination centre and show its oxidation state;
    -  determine the coordination number and name the ligands.
- a) [Rh(NH3)4Cl2]Cl



  

<details> <summary><h3>Explanation: </h3></summary>
   a) [Rh(NH3)4Cl2]Cl
   Name: Tetraamminedichlororhodium(III) chloride
   
Coordination Center: Rhodium (Rh)
Oxidation State of Rhodium: To determine the oxidation state of Rhodium, we can calculate it as follows:
Each ammonia (NH3) ligand is neutral, so four NH3 ligands contribute 0 charges.
Each chloride ion (Cl-) has a charge of -1, and there are two of them, so they contribute a -2 charge.
The overall charge of the complex is neutral (since it's not specified otherwise).
Therefore, the oxidation state of Rhodium (Rh) is +3 to balance the charges.
Coordination Number: 6 (Rhodium is surrounded by six ligands).

Ligands:

Four ammonia (NH3) ligands
Two chloride ions (Cl-)

Inner Sphere:

The coordination center (Rhodium) along with its directly coordinated ligands (four NH3 ligands and two chloride ions).
Outer Sphere:

The outer sphere would include any ions or molecules that are not directly coordinated with the central metal. In this case, it includes the chloride ion (Cl-) outside the square brackets.
So, the inner sphere includes [Rh(NH3)4Cl2], and the outer sphere includes the chloride ion (Cl-) outside the square brackets.
