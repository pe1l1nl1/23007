## Oxidation and reduction processes, coordination compounds

1. Determine the oxidation state of each element: 
- KOH;
- H2SO4;
- I2O5;
- MnO4-;
- Cr2(SO3)3;
- CrO4 2-


<details> <summary> <h3>General Rules for Assigning Oxidation States</h3></summary> 

- For monoatomic ions (ions consisting of a single atom), the oxidation state is equal to the charge of the ion. For example, in KOH, K has an oxidation state of +1, and O and H have oxidation states of -2 and +1, respectively.

- In a compound, the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms must equal the overall charge of the compound.

- Hydrogen (H) typically has an oxidation state of +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals. However, there are exceptions.

- Oxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2 in compounds. However, there are exceptions, such as in peroxides where it has an oxidation state of -1.

- The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a polyatomic ion must equal the charge of the ion. For example, in the sulfate ion (SO4^2-), the sum of the oxidation states of S and O must equal -2.

Using Postulated Oxidation Number Rules
In many cases where you need to calculate the oxidation state, you'll be dealing with atoms earlier in the periodic table. In these cases, you can usually find the oxidation numbers for all or most atoms in a molecule using the following set of rules:

1. The oxidation number of any atom in its elemental form is 0.
2. The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a monatomic ion is equal to the overall charge of that ion.
3. The oxidation number of fluorine is always -1. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine usually have an oxidation number of -1, unless they're combined with oxygen or fluorine.
4. The oxidation number of a Group 1 element in a compound is +1. The alkali metals (group I) always have an oxidation number of +1.
5. The oxidation number of a Group 2 element in a compound is +2. The alkaline earth metals (group II) are always assigned an oxidation number of +2.
6. Oxygen almost always has an oxidation number of -2, except in:
   6.1 peroxides (e.g. H2O2) where it is -1
   6.2 compounds with fluorine (e.g. OF2) where it is +2
7. The oxidation number of H is +1 when combined with more electronegative elements (e.g. non-metals) it is -1 when combined with less electronegative elements (e.g. metals).

<details> <summary><h3>Balancing Redox Reactions by the ion-electron method</h3></summary>

1. Write down the unbalanced equation (skeleton equation) of the chemical reaction. All reactants and products must be known. For a better result write the reaction in ionic form.

2. Redox reaction into half-reactions
- Assign oxidation numbers for each atom in the equation.
- Identify and write out all redox couples in reaction. Identify which reactants are being oxidized (the oxidation number increases when it reacts) and which are being reduced (the oxidation number goes down).
- Combine these redox couples into 2 half-reactions: one for the oxidation, and one for the reduction.

3. Balance the atoms in each half-reaction. A chemical equation must have the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Add appropriate coefficients (stoichiometric coefficients) in front of the chemical formulas. Never change a formula when balancing an equation. Balance each half-reaction separately.
- Balance all the oxygen  (o) atoms. Check if there are the same numbers of oxygen atoms on the left and right side, if they aren't equilibrate these atoms by adding water (h2o) molecules.
- Balance the hydrogen atoms. Check if there are the same numbers of hydrogen atoms on the left and right side, if they aren't equilibrate these atoms by adding protons (H+).

4. Balance the charge. To balance the charge, add electrons (e-) to the more positive side to equal the less positive side of the half-reaction. It doesn't matter what the charge is as long as it is the same on both sides.

5. Make electron gain equivalent to electron loss. The electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction must be equal to the electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction. To make the two equal, multiply the coefficients of all species by integers producing the lowest common multiple between the half-reactions.

6. Add the half-reactions together. The two half-reactions can be combined just like 2 algebraic equations, with the arrow serving the equals sign. Recombine the two half-reactions by adding all the reactants together on the one side and all of the products together on the other side.


7. Simplify the equation. The same species on opposite sides of the arrow can be cancelled. Write the equation so that the coefficients are the smallest set of integers possible.

Finally, always check to see that the equation is balanced. First, verify the equation contains the same type and number of atoms on both sides of the equation.

R:K2Cr2O7 + 4H2SO4 + 6H+ + 6e- → Cr2(SO4)3 + K2SO4 + 7H2O

O:2KI + H2SO4 → I2 + K2SO4 + 2H+ + 2e-| *3
R:K2Cr2O7 + 4H2SO4 + 6H+ + 6e- → Cr2(SO4)3 + K2SO4 + 7H2O| *1

R:K2Cr2O7 + 4H2SO4 + 6H+ + 6e- → Cr2(SO4)3 + K2SO4 + 7H2O

    -  name the coordination centre and show its oxidation state;
    -  determine the coordination number and name the ligands.
- a) [Rh(NH3)4Cl2]Cl



  

<details> <summary><h3>Explanation: </h3></summary>
   a) [Rh(NH3)4Cl2]Cl
   Name: Tetraamminedichlororhodium(III) chloride
   
Coordination Center: Rhodium (Rh)
Oxidation State of Rhodium: To determine the oxidation state of Rhodium, we can calculate it as follows:
Each ammonia (NH3) ligand is neutral, so four NH3 ligands contribute 0 charges.
Each chloride ion (Cl-) has a charge of -1, and there are two of them, so they contribute a -2 charge.
The overall charge of the complex is neutral (since it's not specified otherwise).
Therefore, the oxidation state of Rhodium (Rh) is +3 to balance the charges.
Coordination Number: 6 (Rhodium is surrounded by six ligands).

Ligands:

Four ammonia (NH3) ligands
Two chloride ions (Cl-)

Inner Sphere:

The coordination center (Rhodium) along with its directly coordinated ligands (four NH3 ligands and two chloride ions).
Outer Sphere:

The outer sphere would include any ions or molecules that are not directly coordinated with the central metal. In this case, it includes the chloride ion (Cl-) outside the square brackets.
So, the inner sphere includes [Rh(NH3)4Cl2], and the outer sphere includes the chloride ion (Cl-) outside the square brackets.
