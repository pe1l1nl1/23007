## Oxidation and reduction processes, coordination compounds

1. Determine the oxidation state of each element: KOH; H2SO4; I2O5; MnO4-; Cr2(SO3)3; CrO4 2-

**General Rules for assigning oxidation states**

- For monoatomic ions (ions consisting of a single atom), the oxidation state is equal to the charge of the ion. For example, in KOH, K has an oxidation state of +1, and O and H have oxidation states of -2 and +1, respectively.

- In a compound, the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms must equal the overall charge of the compound.

- Hydrogen (H) typically has an oxidation state of +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals. However, there are exceptions.

- Oxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2 in compounds. However, there are exceptions, such as in peroxides where it has an oxidation state of -1.

- The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a polyatomic ion must equal the charge of the ion. For example, in the sulfate ion (SO4^2-), the sum of the oxidation states of S and O must equal -2.

```
- KOH (K:+1, O:-2, H:+1)
- H2SO4 (H: +1, S: +6, O: -2)
- I2O5 (I: 0, O:-2)
- MnO4- ( Mn: +7, O:-2) 
- Cr2(SO3)3 (Cr: +3, S: +4, O: -2) 
- CrO42- ( Cr:+6, O:-2)


2. Finish the equation of oxidation or reduction processes:
   - a) Fe2+ → Fe3+  
   - b) Al3+ → Al
   - c) N3- → N2↑
   - d) In3+ → In+

Answers:
   - Fe2+ --> Fe3+ + e-
   - Oxidation Fe2+ loses an electron (e-)
   - Al3+ + 3e- -> Al
   - Reduction where Al3+ gains 3 electrons.
   - N3- + 3 e- -> N2
   - Reduction N3- gains 3 electrons
   - In3 + 3 e- -> In+
   - Reduction In3 gains 3 electrons.

11. Name the following coordination compounds:
     - show the inner and outer spheres of each compound;
    -  name the coordination centre and show its oxidation state;
    -  determine the coordination number and name the ligands.
- a) [Rh(NH3)4Cl2]Cl

  Name: Tetraamminedichlororhodium(III) chloride

Explanation:

Coordination Center: Rhodium (Rh)
Oxidation State of Rhodium: To determine the oxidation state of Rhodium, we can calculate it as follows:
Each ammonia (NH3) ligand is neutral, so four NH3 ligands contribute 0 charge.
Each chloride ion (Cl-) has a charge of -1, and there are two of them, so they contribute -2 charge.
The overall charge of the complex is neutral (since it's not specified otherwise).
Therefore, the oxidation state of Rhodium (Rh) is +3 to balance the charges.
Coordination Number: 6 (Rhodium is surrounded by six ligands).

Ligands:

Four ammonia (NH3) ligands
Two chloride ions (Cl-)

Inner Sphere:

The coordination center (Rhodium) along with its directly coordinated ligands (four NH3 ligands and two chloride ions).
Outer Sphere:

The outer sphere would include any ions or molecules that are not directly coordinated to the central metal. In this case, it includes the chloride ion (Cl-) outside the square brackets.
So, the inner sphere includes [Rh(NH3)4Cl2], and the outer sphere includes the chloride ion (Cl-) outside the square brackets.
