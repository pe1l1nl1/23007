# pH, pOH, H3O+, OH-, Kw, Ka, Kb, pKa, and pKb Basic Calculations -Acids and Bases Chemistry Problems


### formulas to remember 

ph = -log [H3O+]
pOH = -log [OH-]
pH + pOH = 14

[H3O+] = 1O^-pH
[OH-] = 10^-pOH

[H3O+][OH-] = 1 x 10^-14


pKa = -log [Ka]
pKb = -log [Kb]
pKa + pKb = 14

[pKa] = 1O^-pKa
[pKb] = 10^-pKb

[pKa][pKb] = 1 x 10^-14
