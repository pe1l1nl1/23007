# Chemistry for medical students

## Study Course Abstract
The study course is developed for the students of medicine. The aim of the course is to provide knowledge about properties and laws of organic and inorganic compounds. The study course is divided into two parts.
The first part is devoted to the basic knowledge of inorganic and analytical chemistry. The acid-base theories, red-ox processes, complex compounds of biological systems, as well as thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium are discussed. An insight into classical and modern methods of analysis is given.
The second part is devoted to the fundamentals of structure, stereoisomers and reaction mechanisms of organic compounds. Students acquire structure activity relationships of the main families of organic compounds, their properties and role in biochemical processes and pharmacy.
The purpose of the course is to develop students' understanding and skills on basic chemistry relationships and classes of substances that are important in the bioprocesses of the living organisms.

## Requirements for Awarding Credits

Participation in seminars and practical laboratory work is compulsory.
Students have to demonstrate successful attainment of the learning outcomes in:

## Intermediate assessment

1. Laboratory practice: successfully finished 7 experiments and defended lab reports (20%),
2. Tests 1- 4 - problem-solving (total 40%, each 10%)
- Test 1 â€“ topics No.1-3 
- Test 2 - topics No. 4-7
- Test 3 - topics No.8 -9
- Test 4 - topics No.10-11
   
## Final assessment

3. written examination (40%). The exam consists of two parts. The exam is passed if the student gets a passing grade in each of the exam parts.
