Write the chemical formula of the coordination compound potassium dicyanoargentate (I), what is the coordination number? 



```Rules for naming the coordination compounds

Nomenclature for coordination compounds, while it may seem complex, can be broken down into a few simple rules. Here's a basic guide to naming coordination compounds:

1. **Cation First**:
   - Start with the name of the metal ion (the cation) at the center of the complex. This is usually the element from the transition metals.

2. **Anionic Ligands**:
   - Name the anionic ligands (molecules or ions that bind to the metal) next. Common examples include chloride (Cl-), sulfate (SO4^2-), and cyanide (CN-).

3. **Neutral Ligands**:
   - After the anionic ligands, name any neutral ligands (molecules like H2O, NH3, CO, etc.) in alphabetical order.

4. **Ligand Prefixes**:
   - Use prefixes like di- (for 2), tri- (for 3), tetra- (for 4), etc., to indicate the number of a particular ligand, e.g., tetraammine.

5. **Ligand Names**:
   - The ligands' names often end in "-o" when they are negatively charged and "-a" for neutral ligands. For example, chloride becomes chloro, and ammonia becomes ammine.

6. **Ligand Multiplicity**:
   - If a ligand appears multiple times, use prefixes like bis- (for 2), tris- (for 3), tetrakis- (for 4), etc., before the ligand name.

7. **Coordination Number**:
   - If the metal can have different oxidation states, indicate its charge in Roman numerals in parentheses. For example, if Fe in a complex has a +2 charge, you write iron(II).

8. **Overall Charge**:
   - Finish by indicating the overall charge of the complex. This can be found by summing the charges of the metal ion and the ligands.

9. **Square Brackets**:
   - Enclose the entire complex in square brackets, and include the charge of the complex as a superscript outside the bracket.

Here's an example:

Let's name the complex [Pt(NH3)4Cl2]Br2:

1. Start with the metal: platinum.
2. Then, name the anionic ligand: chloride.
3. Followed by the neutral ligand: ammonia.
4. Use prefixes to indicate the number of ligands: tetraammine, dichloro.
5. Combine it all: tetraammine dichloroplatinum.
6. Add the charge of the complex: tetraammine dichloroplatinum(IV).
7. Finally, indicate the counterion outside the square brackets: tetraammine dichloroplatinum(IV) bromide.

That's a simplified guide to naming coordination compounds. Keep in mind that this is a basic overview, and there are more complex rules and exceptions in the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) nomenclature system for coordination compounds, especially for cases involving different coordination isomers and structural isomers.

**How to write Half- Reactions with H2O, H+ and OH-**
``` How to write Half- Reactions with H2O, H+ and OH-
Writing half-reactions involving H2O, H+ (hydrogen ions), and OH- (hydroxide ions) is commonly encountered in redox chemistry, especially in the context of acid-base reactions and water electrolysis. Here's how to write half-reactions involving these species:

1. **Balancing the Reaction**:

   Before writing the half-reaction, you need to balance the overall chemical equation for the reaction you're interested in. This means ensuring that the number of atoms of each element and the total charge on both sides of the equation are equal.

2. **Writing the Half-Reaction**:

   A half-reaction is written for the oxidation or reduction of a species. It typically takes the form:

   - Oxidation half-reaction: 
     Species oxidized ⟶ Products + electrons (e-)

   - Reduction half-reaction: 
     Species reduced + electrons (e-) ⟶ Products

   When involving H2O, H+, and OH-, these are commonly used half-reaction components:

   - **H2O in Acidic Solution**:
     In an acidic solution, you can use H2O as a reactant, and it will be converted into H+ ions and OH- ions. For example:

     **Oxidation half-reaction**: H2O ⟶ 2H+ + 1/2O2 + 2e-

     **Reduction half-reaction**: 2H2O + 2e- ⟶ H2 + 2OH-

   - **H+ and OH- Ions**:
     In some cases, you might deal with reactions in which H+ and OH- ions participate. For example:

     **Oxidation half-reaction**: 4H+ + O2 + 4e- ⟶ 2H2O

     **Reduction half-reaction**: 4OH- ⟶ O2 + 2H2O + 4e-

3. **Balancing the Half-Reaction**:

   Balance the number of atoms and charges on each side of the half-reaction. Ensure that the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction is equal to the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction. This balance is necessary to make the half-reactions compatible with each other in the context of the overall reaction.

4. **Combining Half-Reactions**:

   After balancing the half-reactions, you can combine them to form the overall redox reaction. Make sure the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction is equal to the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction. You may need to multiply one or both of the half-reactions by appropriate factors to achieve this balance.

Remember that the choice of whether to include H2O, H+, or OH- in a half-reaction depends on the specific reaction you're dealing with and the conditions (acidic, basic, or neutral). Balancing and combining half-reactions can sometimes be complex, especially in the context of more complicated redox reactions, so practice is essential to master this skill.

**Compare electrolysis and galvanic cell:**

```text
Electrolysis and a galvanic cell (also known as a voltaic cell) are two different processes involving electrochemical reactions. They both involve the movement of electrons and ions, but they serve distinct purposes and operate in opposite ways. Here's a comparison of the two:

1. Purpose:

- Electrolysis: Electrolysis is used to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction by applying an external electrical current. It is commonly used to separate compounds, plate metals, or produce specific chemical products. For example, it's used in the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gas or in electroplating processes.

- Galvanic Cell: A galvanic cell is designed to generate electrical energy from a spontaneous chemical reaction. It converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Galvanic cells are used in batteries and power sources like the ones found in everyday devices.

2. Reaction Direction:

- Electrolysis: Electrolysis forces a non-spontaneous redox reaction to occur by applying an external voltage greater than the cell potential. This means it drives a chemical reaction in a direction that would not naturally occur.

- Galvanic Cell: A galvanic cell operates in a spontaneous redox reaction, meaning the chemical reaction occurs naturally and produces an electric current as a result of the electron flow from the anode to the cathode.

3. Anode and Cathode:

- Electrolysis: In electrolysis, the anode is the electrode where oxidation (loss of electrons) occurs, and the cathode is the electrode where reduction (gain of electrons) occurs. This allows the movement of ions towards their respective electrodes.

- Galvanic Cell: In a galvanic cell, the anode is where oxidation occurs, and the cathode is where reduction occurs as well. The flow of electrons and ions in a galvanic cell generates electrical energy.

4. Energy Flow:

- Electrolysis: Electrical energy is consumed during electrolysis to drive the non-spontaneous reaction.

- Galvanic Cell: Electrical energy is produced as a result of the spontaneous chemical reaction in a galvanic cell.

5. Examples:

- Electrolysis: Electrolysis is commonly used in applications like electroplating, water splitting, and the production of certain chemicals.

- Galvanic Cell: Galvanic cells are used in everyday batteries, such as alkaline batteries, lithium-ion batteries, and lead-acid batteries.

In summary, the key difference between electrolysis and a galvanic cell is their purpose and the direction of the electrochemical reaction. Electrolysis is used to drive non-spontaneous reactions for various purposes, while a galvanic cell generates electrical energy from spontaneous chemical reactions.
