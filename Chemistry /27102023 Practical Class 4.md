### Titration of Sulfuric Acid and Sodiu Hydroxide

The complete balanced equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide is:
H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O

Thus, writing this in a full ionic reaction form , we get:
2H+ + SO42- + 2 Na+ + 2OH– → 2Na+ + SO42- + 2H2O

So, the net ionic equation of sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide, after crossing out the spectator ions, is:
2H+ + 2OH– → 2H2O


Number of Moles (N) = Volume (V) x Molarity (M), thus the formula becomes 
N = 0.0125 x 0.1 = 0.00125 moles 

Now, according to the equation 1 mentioned above, exactly half the number of moles of sulfuric acid take part in the reaction; i.e., the number of moles required for the neutralization process are:

N (for sulfuric acid) = 0.00125/2 = 0.000625 moles

The volume of sulfuric acid used in this experiment is 10 ml. By rearranging the above formula, the molarity or concentration of H2SO4 is calculated:

Molarity (M) = Number of Moles (N)/Volume (V) M = 0.000625/0.01 = 0.0625mol/L

Thus, the molarity or concentration of sulfuric acid in the above-described experiment is 0.0625 mol/L.
