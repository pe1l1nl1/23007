<details open id=5 ><summary><h3> Sample obtaining iron (II) sulfate was dissolved in deionized water in 250mL volumetric flask and the flask filled with deionized water up to the mark. 25.00mL of the solution 
was transferred to a conical flask, diluted sulfuric acid was added and the solution was titrated permanganatometrically with 0.02025M potassium permanganate solution and 18.65mL of this 
solution was used. Calculate the mass of iron (II) sulfate in the sample if the titration reaction takes place according to the following equation:

10 FeSO4 + 2 KMnO4 + 8 H2SO4 → 5 Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 MnSO4 + 8 H2O + K2SO4
