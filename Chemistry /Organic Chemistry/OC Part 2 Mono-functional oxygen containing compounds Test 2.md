**Concise explanation:**
The question covers a broad range of topics related to oxygen-containing compounds, their physical properties, applications, acidity, oxidation and reduction reactions, reactions involving C=O bonds, reactions with amino-type structures, and derivatives of carboxylic acids. I'll provide a brief overview of each section:

### Structure of Mono-functional Oxygen-Containing Compounds:

1. **Alcohols:** These compounds have the general formula R-OH, where R is an organic group. The oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom, and alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the number of carbon groups attached to the carbon with the hydroxyl group.

2. **Phenols:** These compounds have a hydroxyl group (-OH) directly attached to an aromatic ring. The general formula is Ar-OH, where Ar represents an aromatic ring.

3. **Carboxylic Acids:** These compounds have the general formula R-COOH, where R is an organic group. The functional group consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the same carbon.

### Physical Properties and Applications:

- **Alcohols:** Alcohols are polar compounds with higher boiling points than analogous hydrocarbons. They are commonly used as solvents, antiseptics, and in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

- **Phenols:** Phenols are more acidic than alcohols. They are used in the production of plastics, disinfectants, and pharmaceuticals.

- **Carboxylic Acids:** Carboxylic acids are polar and typically have higher boiling points. They are used in the food industry (e.g., acetic acid in vinegar), pharmaceuticals, and as solvents.

### Acidity Comparison:

The acidity of these compounds increases in the order: of alcohols < phenols < carboxylic acids. This trend can be demonstrated by their reactions with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide:

\[ \text{RCOOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{RCOONa} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

\[ \text{ROH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{RONa} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

\[ \text{ArOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{ArO}^- \text{Na}^+ + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

### Oxidation and Reduction Reactions:

- **Oxidation:** Alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids. Primary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes first and then further to carboxylic acids. Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones. Phenols are not easily oxidized under mild conditions.

- **Reduction:** Aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to alcohols. Carboxylic acids can be reduced to primary alcohols. Phenols can be reduced to benzene under certain conditions.

### Reactions of Addition to C=O Bonds:

- **Nucleophilic Addition:** Compounds containing a C=O bond, such as aldehydes and ketones, undergo nucleophilic addition reactions with nucleophiles like water, alcohols, and amines.

\[ \text{RCHO or RCOR'} + \text{Nu}^- \rightarrow \text{RC(OH)Nu or RC(OR')Nu} \]

### Reactions of Carbonyl Compounds with Amino-Type Structures:

- **Nucleophilic Addition of Amines:** Aldehydes and ketones react with amines to form imines or enamines.

\[ \text{RCHO or RCOR'} + \text{NH}_3 \rightarrow \text{RCH=NH or RCR'=NH} \]

### Derivatives of Carboxylic Acids:

- **Esters, Amides, Anhydrides:** Derivatives of carboxylic acids can be formed by reacting carboxylic acids with alcohols, amines, or other carboxylic acids, respectively.

### Stability and Hydrolysis of Derivatives:

- **Esters and Amides:** Esters are less stable than amides. Both can undergo hydrolysis in the presence of acids or bases.

### Reactions of Preparation of Derivatives:

- **Esters:** Formed by reacting a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.

\[ \text{RCOOH} + \text{R'}\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{acid}} \text{RCOOR'} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

- **Amides:** Formed by reacting a carboxylic acid with an amine.

\[ \text{RCOOH} + \text{NH}_3 \rightarrow \text{RC(O)NH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

This overview provides a concise summary of the key points for each topic. Each point can be expanded into more detailed explanations and reactions based on the depth of understanding required.
