### Lewis acid-base theory 

### Measuring the PH

--->pH9 colourless pink <--- 

### Acic Constant Ka 

we do not include water in heterogeneous equilibrium 

Ka = [A-][H3O+]/[HA] 
pKa = - lgKa 

### Relationship btw Ka and Kb 

pKa + Pkb = pKw 

Ka + Kb = Kw = 1.0 * 10^-14

-lgKa -lgKb = -lgKw 

**This relationship can be applied within only one conjugate acid-base pair**
