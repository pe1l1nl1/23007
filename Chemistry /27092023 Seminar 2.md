# Theories of Acids and Bases 

- The **Arrhenius theory** of acids and bases states that  “an acid generates H+ ions in a solution whereas a base produces an OH– ion in its solution”
- The **Bronsted-Lowry theory** defines "an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor"
- The **Lewis definition** of acids and bases describes "acids"

# Strong acid/Base versus Weak Acid/Base

- Strong acids and bases **fully** dissociate in solution

- Strength refers to the % molecules that form IONS.
- A strong acid or base will **completely ionize (>95% as ions)** This is represented by a single (->) arrow.

- A weak acid or base will partially ionize (<5% as ions). This is represented by a double (<->) arrow.
