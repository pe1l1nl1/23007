# Seminar 2 

pH of protolyte solutions, buffered solutions, insoluble compounds

### 1. Mark, which of these protolytes are acids, bases or are amphiprotic: NaOH, HS-, HCl, CO32-, NH4+, H2PO4-, CN-, Ba(OH)2

- Strong acids: HCI (dissociates completely to the water forming H+ and CI- ions) 
- Strong bases: NaOH, Ba(OH)2 (dissociates completely to the water forming Na+ and OH- ions, Ba2+ and OH- ions) 
- Weak bases: HS-, CO32-, CN- (accepts protons (H+) to from water)
- Amphiprotic:  HS-, CO32-, NH4+, H2PO4-, CN- 

### 2.What is the conjugate base of HClO4, H2S, PH4+, HCO3-? 
- Conjugate base of HClO4 is ClO4- (perchlorate).
- Conjugate base of H2S is HS- (hydrosulfide).
- Conjugate base of PH4+ is PH3 (phosphine).
- Conjugate base of HCO3- is CO3^2- (carbonate).

*Identify the acid, remove a proton (H+), note the charge, check for charges in formula: In some cases, the chemical formula of the acid and its conjugate base may differ, especially for polyprotic acids. For example, H2CO3 (carbonic acid) loses one proton to become HCO3-, and then loses another proton to become CO3^2-.*

*Acid: HCl and Conjugate Base: Cl-*

*Acid: H2SO4 (sulfuric acid); Conjugate Base: HSO4- (hydrogen sulfate)*

*Acid: H2CO3 (carbonic acid); First Conjugate Base: HCO3- (bicarbonate); Second Conjugate Base: CO3^2- (carbonate)*

*Acid: H3PO4 (phosphoric acid); First Conjugate Base: H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate); Second Conjugate Base: HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate); Third Conjugate Base: PO4^3- (phosphate)*

- Not all acids are monoprotic (gives away only one proton H+) some acids can be polyprotic (gives away multiple protons), which results in a series of conjugate bases, as shown in the examples above.

### 3. What is the conjugate acid of CN-, SO2-4, H2O, and HCO-3? 

*similar to predicting a base subtracting a proton (H+), predicting acid adding a proton (H+)*
- Conjugate acid of CN- (cyanide ion): HCN (hydrocyanic acid)
- Conjugate acid of SO4^2- (sulfate ion): H2SO4 (sulfuric acid)
- Conjugate acid of H2O (water): H3O+ (hydronium ion)
- Conjugate acid of HCO3- (bicarbonate ion): H2CO3 (carbonic acid)
  
### 4. Predict whether aqueous solutions of the following compounds are acidic, basic, or neutral: NH4NO3, FeCl3, Na2CO3, KClO4, Na2C2O4. 

- NH4NO3 solution is slightly acidic (NH4+ is weak acid, NO3- is neutral)
- FeCl3 solution is neutral (Fe^3 + and Cl- ions are neither strongly acidic nor basic, so the solution is neutral)
- Na2CO3 solution is slightly basic (Na+ and CO3^2 - which is weak bases)
- KClO4 solution is neutral (K+ and ClO4- both are not strongly acidic or basic, the solution is neutral)
- Na2C2O4 solution is slightly basic (Na+ and C2O4^2- which is weak bases, so the solution will be slightly basic)

### 5. Calculate the pH of the following solutions:  a) 0.01M H2SO4,  b) 0.001M KOH;  c) 1.0M NH3;  d) 0.05M H3PO4;  e) 0.20M NH4Cl;  f) 0.01M Cu(NO3)2;  g) 0.05M K3PO4;  h) 0.01M NaNO2; i) 0.50 M Na2HPO4; j) 0.30 M NaH2PO4. 

a)0.01M H2SO4 (strong acid); H+ = 2x0.01M = 0.02M; pH = -log(0.02) ≈ 1.70

b)0.001M KOH (strong base); OH- = 0.001M; pH = 14- (-log(0.001)) ≈11

c)1.0M NH3 (weak base);  Kb for NH3 is 1.8x10^-5 ; [OH-] = sqrt(Kb x [NH3]) = sqrt((1.8 x 10^-5) x 1.0) ≈ 0.00424M
To find the pH, pOH: pOH = -log(0.00424) ≈ 2.37
Since pH + pOH = 14, pH ≈ 14 - 2.37 ≈ 11.63

d) 0.05M H3PO4; weak triprotic acid; consider to dissociation of the first proton (H+); H3PO4 <-> H+ +H2PO4-; [H+] = Ka x [H3PO4] = (7.5 x 10^-3) ≈ 3.75 x 10^-4 M
pH = log (3.75 x 10^-4) ≈ 3.43

**pH = 0.5 (2.1 + log 0.05) = 1.7**

e) NH4+; Cl-. NH4+ is a weak acid. NH4 <-> H+ + NH3; Ka for NH4+ = 5.6 x10^-10 
    H+ = sqrt (Ka x NH4+) = sqrt ((5.6x10^-10)x 0.20) ≈ 1.33 x 10^-5 M
    pH = -log(1.33x10^-5) ≈ 4.88

**pH=0.5x12 - 0.5(log0.2)= 4.95**

f) 0.01M Cu(NO3)2; Cu(NO3)2 is a salt of a transition metal and nitrate ions, which do not undergo significant hydrolysis. The solution is neutral approximately 7  

**Cu (affects the pH) is a weak acid**
**pH = 0.5x 8.0 - 0.5xlg0.01 =5.0**

g) 0.05M K3PO4 is a salt of a strong base (KOH) and a weak acid (H3PO4). It will produce K+ and this solution is alkaline (basic) due to the presence of the strong base, so the pH will be higher than 7. We don't need to perform a detailed calculation in this case.

**pH= 7 + 0.5x12.4 + 0.5lg0.05 = 12.55**

h) NaOH (strong base) and HNO2 (weak acid). HNO2 = Na + and NO2- ions in solution. NO2- + H2O <-> HNO2 + OH- 
Kb for N2O <-> HNO2 + OH- 
Kb for NO2- is 1.0 x 10^-4 (at 25°C) 
OH- = sqrt (Kb x NO2-) = sqrt ((1.0 x 10^-4)x 0.01) ≈ 1.0 x 10^-3 M
pOH = -log(1.0x10^-3) = 3
pH = 14-3 = 11

**pH = 14 - 0.5x 10.7 + 0.5lg0.01 = 7.65**

i) Na2HPO4, NaOH (strong base) and H2PO4- (weak acid), which produces Na+ and HPO4^2- ions in the solution. HPO4^2- is a weak base, therefore we consider its dissociation: HPO4^2- + H20 <-> H2PO4- + OH- 
Kb (HPO4^2-) = 2.2 x 10^-13 (at 25°C)
OH- = sqrt(Kb x HPO4^2-) = sqrt ((2.2 x 10^-13)x 0.50) ≈ 2.35 x 10^-7M 
pOH = 14- (-log(2.35 x 10^-7)) = 14-6.63 ≈ 7.37 

**pH = 0.5x12.4 + 0.5x7.2 = 9.8**

j)0.30M NaH2PO4: 
NaH2PO4 is a salt of a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (H2PO4-), which Na + and H2PO4- ions in solution. 

H2PO4- (weak acid) and we consider its dissociation: H2PO4- <-> H+ + HPO4^2- 
Ka (HPO4^2-)= 6.2 x 10^-9 (at 25°C) 
H+ = Ka x (H2PO4- = (6.2 x 10^-8 )x0.30 ≈ 1.86 x10^-8M 
pH = -log (1.86 x 10^-8) ≈ 7.73

**pH = 0.5x7.2 + 0.5x2.1 = 4.65**

### 6. You have to prepare a buffered solution with pH = 7.5. Which protolytic pair will you choose? What should be the ratio between the components of the buffered solution? What should be the base concentration if the concentration of acid is 0.10 M?  

pH = pKa + log (A-/HA) 
pH = 7.5
pKa = pKa weak acid CH3COOH
A- = concentration of the conjugate base CH3COO-
HA = concentration of the weak acid CH3COOH

to achieve pH = 7.5, use pKa value for acetic acid, 4.76

7.5= 4.76 + log (A-/HA) 
A-/HA = 10^2.74 ≈ 495.81 

concentration of CH3COOH is 0.10M then the concentration of CH3COO- = 0.10M x 495.81 ≈ 49.58M

**correct answer:**
pKa+ -1 pKa range 6.5-8.5 
use H2PO4 = 6.2 

7.5 = 7.2 + lg (Cb/Ca) 
0.3 = lg(Cb/Ca) 
Cb/Ca = 10^0.3 -> 2 

If acid concentration is Ca= 0.1, then Cb = 0.2 M 



### 7. To 200 mL of 0.1 M CH3 COONa solution, 100 mL of 0.1 M CH3 COOH solution are added. What will be the pH of the new solution? Write the full ionic equation of the reaction that happens when HCl is added to the solution! Write the full ionic equation of the reaction that happens when NaOH is added to the solution! 

pH = pKa + log(A-/HA)  *Henderson-Hasselbalch equation*


The full ionic equation for this reaction is:
CH3COO- + H+ + HCl -> CH3COOH + Cl-

Adding NaOH to the solution, it reacts with acetic acid (CH3COOH) to form acetate ions (CH3COO-) and water (H2O).

CH3COOH + OH-  -> CH3COO- + H2O

**correct answer:**

CH3COOH (weak acid) and CH3COONa (conjugate base), pKa for acetic acid (4.8)
Ca= (0.1M x 100mL)/300mL = 0.033mL
Cb= (0.1x 200mL)/300mL = 0.067mL

pH = 4.8 + log (0.067mL/0.033mL) = 5.1 


CH3COONa + HCl -> CH3COOH + NaCl 
CH3COONa + NaOH -> Ch3COONa + H2O


### 8. The buffered solution is prepared by dissolving 20.0 g of acetic acid (CH3 COOH) and 20.0 g of sodium acetate (CH3 COONa) in 1.0 L of deionized water. Calculate the pH of the buffer!  

calculate the number of moles of each compound:
- moles of

### 9. Write the solubility-product constant of (Mg3(PO4)2)! 

Ksp = [Mg2+]^3 * [PO4^3-]^2


### 10. The molar solubility of silver chromate (Ag2CrO4) is 6.5·10-5 mol/L. Calculate the Ksp!  

Ksp = [Ag+]^2 x [CrO4^2-]

Ksp = (6.5 x 10^-5)^2 x [CrO4^2-]

### 11. Will precipitate form if 50 mL of 0.05 M potassium chromate solution is added to 100 mL of 0.02 M silver nitrate solution? (𝐾𝑠𝑝,𝐴𝑔2𝐶𝑟𝑂4 =1.1∙10−12)  

We need to compare the ion product (IP) to the solubility product constant (Ksp) for silver chromate (Ag2CrO4).
The ion product (IP) is calculated as follows:

IP = [Ag+] * [CrO4^2-]

Calculate the concentrations of Ag+ and CrO4^2- ions after mixing the solutions. Then, calculate IP.

If IP is greater than Ksp (1.1 x 10^-12 for Ag2CrO4), a precipitate will form because the solution is supersaturated.


**correct answer**

Qsp = [Ag+]^2 x [CrO2-4] = 0.013^2 x 0.017M = 2.8 x10^-6 
CAg+ = 0.02M x 100mL/ 150mL = 0.013M
CCro2-4 = 0.05M x100mL/150mL= 0.017M 

Compare Qsp  and Ksp (1.1 x 10^-12), the result is that Qsp> Ksp, a precipitate will form because the solution is supersaturated. 


### 12. The solubility-product constant of cobalt carbonate is 1.05·10-10. Calculate how many μg of CoCO3 will dissolve in 100 mL of water!  

### 13. The solubility of lead iodide (PbI2) in 100 mL of water is 0.068 g. Calculate the solubility-product constant of lead iodide!
