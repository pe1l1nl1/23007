**How to write half-reactions with H2O, OH- and H+ ?**


How do you know the proper equation when H2O, H+, and OH- are involved? For example, in homework problem #13.11 part (d), the following cell diagram is given:

Pt l O2 l H+ ll OH- l O2 l Pt

In this case, the half-reactions are

O2 + 2H2O +4e- --> 4 OH-
O2 + 4H+ +4e- -->2H2O


To solve this problem, balance the following half-reactions from the cell diagram:

```text 
O2 —> H+
O2 —> OH-

If you balance the first reaction as a standard reduction reaction in acidic solution, you get:
O2 + 4H+ + 4e- ---> 2H2O.

If you balance the second reaction as a standard reduction reaction in basic solution you get:
O2 + 2H2O + 4e- ---> 4 OH-

In a cell diagram, the anode is always on the left of the double lines and the cathode is on the right. This means the species on the left are involved in the oxidation half-reaction and the species on the right are involved in the reduction half-reaction.

Therefore:
Anode (oxidation): 2H2O ---> O2 + 4H+ + 4e-
Cathode (reduction): O2 + 2H2O + 4e- ---> 4 OH-

Adding the above two half-reactions gives the balanced redox reaction:
4H2O ---> 4H+ + 4 OH-
