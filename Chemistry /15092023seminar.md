### Liquid systems and solutions, chemical equilibrium.
1. 1.25 moles of sodium hydroxide were dissolved in 450 grams of water. Calculate the mass fraction (%) of sodium hydroxide in the solution! (MNaOH = 40.0 g/mol)

**My solution**
```
n (NaOH) = 1.25 mol
m (water) = 450g 
M(MNaOH) = 40.0 g/mol

m (NaOH) = 1.25 mol x 40.0g/mol = 50.0g
total mass of solution = mass of water + mass of NaOH = 450g + 50.0g = 500g

w (%) = m(NaOH) / total mass of the solution x100%
     = 50.0g/500g x100%
    = 10%

A: the mass fraction of NaOH in the solution is 10%.

```
2.  In 800 cubic centimetres of water, 20 grams of sodium sulfate decahydrate were dissolved. Calculate sodium sulfate mass fraction (%) in the solution! (𝑀𝑁𝑎2𝑆𝑂4 =142.04 𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙; 𝑀𝑁𝑎2𝑆𝑂4∙10𝐻2𝑂=322.0 𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙)

**My solution**
```
V (water) = 800 cubic metres = 800g
m (Na2SO4·10H2O) = 20g

n = m/M = 20g/322.1g/mol ≈ 0.062mol

sodium mass fraction:
w(%) = mass of Na2SO4·10H2O / Total mass of the solution × 100%
    = (0.062 mol x 322,1g/mol )/(800g)
    = 2.5%

A: sodium sulfate w(%) in the solution is approximately 2.5%.

3.  During 24 hours, an average amount of 800 mL of gastric juice is secreted in the stomach (ρ = 1.065 g/mL). Gastric acid contains ≈ 0.5% hydrogen chloride. Calculate the total mass of hydrogen chloride that enters the stomach with gastric acid daily!

**My solution**
```
V  = 800ml 
V Hydrogen chloride = 0.005 x 800ml = 4ml
p = m/V
m = pV
m = 1.065g/ml x 4ml = 4.26ml

A: 4.26ml (HCI) 

```
4. Calculate the mass and amount of aluminium ions that are in 300 mL of 24 % aluminium sulfate solution (ρ = 1.309 g/mL).

**My solution**
```
m = pV

m of the solution = 300ml x 1.309 g/ml =  392.7g
m(aluminium sulfate) = 392.7g x 0.24 = 94.25g
M (aluminium sulfate ) = 342.17g/mol
n (aluminium sulfate) = m/M = 94.25g/ 342.17g/mol ≈ 0.2755mol
mol of aluminium ions (3) = 0.2755mol x 3 = 0.8265mol

A: 0.8265mol of aluminium ions in 300ml of the 24% aluminium sulfate solution.

```
5. A 0.84 M solution of acetic acid is given, its density is 1.01 g/mL. Calculate the mass fraction of acetic acid (%) in the solution.

**My solution**
```
p = 1.01g/ml
c= 0.84 mol/L
m mass of the solution = volume x density = 1L x 1.01 g/ml = 1010g
n = 0.84mol/L x 1L = 0.84mol

M (CH3COOH) = 60.03g/mol
m = nM = 0.84mol x 60.03g/mol = 50.43g

w% ( mass of acetic acid/ mass of solution) x 100% = 50.43g/1010g = 4.99%

A: the mass fraction of acetic acid in the solution is approximately 4.99%

6.  You have a stock solution of 14.8 M NH3. How many millilitres of this solution should you dilute to make 100.0 mL of 0.250 M NH3? If you take a 10.0 mL portion of the stock solution and dilute it to the total volume of 0.250 L, what will be the concentration of the final solution?

9. Write the expression for Kc (equilibrium constant) for the following reactions. In each case indicate whether the reaction is homogeneous or heterogeneous.
- a) CH4 (g) + 2H2S (g) ⇌ CS2(g) + 4H2(g)     
- b) Ni(CO)4 (g) ⇌ Ni (s) + 4CO (g)
- c) HF (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + F- (aq)
- d) 2Ag (s) + Zn2+ (aq) ⇌ 2Ag+ (aq) + Zn (s)

**My solution**
```
a) Kc = CS2 * (H2)^2 / CH4 * (H2S)^2 homogeneous, all species are in the gas phase.
b) Kc = (CO)^4 / Ni(CO)^4 heterogeneous, involves species in both the gas phase and the solid phase
c) Kc = (H+)(F-)/ (HF) homogeneous because all species are in liquid phase 
d) Kc = (Ag+)^2 / (Zn2+) heterogeneous because it involves species in solid and liquid phase
