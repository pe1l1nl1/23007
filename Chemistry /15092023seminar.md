Gastric acid contains ≈ 0.5% hydrogen chloride. Calculate the total mass of hydrogen chloride that enters the stomach with gastric acid daily! 4. Calculate the mass and amount of aluminium ions that are in 300 mL of 24 % aluminium sulfate solution (ρ = 1.309 g/mL). 5. A 0.84 M solution of acetic acid is given, its density 1.01 g/mL. Calculate the mass fraction of acetic acid (%) in the solution. 6. You have a stock solution of 14.8 M NH3. How many milliliters of this solution should you dilute to make 100.0 mL of 0.250 M NH3?

Finish the molecular equations and write full and net ionic equation for the reactions that take place: a) Cr2(SO4)3 + NaOH → b) HBr + Ba(OH)2 → c) NaCl + NiSO4 → d) Na2CO3 + HNO3 → 9. Write the expression for Kc (equilibrium constant) for the following reactions. In each case indicate whether the reaction is homogeneous or heterogeneous.  a) CH4 (g) + 2H2S (g) ⇌ CS2(g) + 4H2(g) b) Ni(CO)4 (g) ⇌ Ni (s) + 4CO (g) c) HF (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + F- (aq) d) 2Ag (s) + Zn2+ (aq) ⇌ 2Ag+ (aq) + Zn (s)   2 Ķīmi1100: Chemistry for medical students  10. The equilibrium constant for the reaction 2NO (g) + Br2 (g) ⇌ 2NOBr (g) is Kc = 1.3·10-2 at 1000 K. a) Calculate K'c for the reaction 2NOBr (g) ⇌ 2NO (g) + Br2 (g). b) At this temperature does the equilibrium favor NO and O2, or does it favor NOBr?  11. The equilibrium 2NO (g) + Cl2 (g) ⇌ 2NOCl (g) is established at 500 K.
