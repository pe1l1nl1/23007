### Liquid systems and solutions, chemical equilibrium.
1. 1.25 moles of sodium hydroxide were dissolved in 450 grams of water. Calculate the mass fraction (%) of sodium hydroxide in the solution! (MNaOH = 40.0 g/mol)

**My solution**
```
n (NaOH) = 1.25 mol
m (water) = 450g 
M(MNaOH) = 40.0 g/mol

m (NaOH) = 1.25 mol x 40.0g/mol = 50.0g
total mass of solution = mass of water + mass of NaOH = 450g + 50.0g = 500g

w (%) = m(NaOH) / total mass of the solution x100%
     = 50.0g/500g x100%
    = 10%

A: the mass fraction of NaOH in the solution is 10%.

```
2.  In 800 cubic centimetres of water, 20 grams of sodium sulfate decahydrate were dissolved. Calculate sodium sulfate mass fraction (%) in the solution! (𝑀𝑁𝑎2𝑆𝑂4 =142.04 𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙; 𝑀𝑁𝑎2𝑆𝑂4∙10𝐻2𝑂=322.0 𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙)

**My solution**
```
1 cm^3 = 1ml

V (water) = 800 cubic metres = 800g
m (Na2SO4·10H2O) = 20g

n = m/M = 20g/322.1g/mol ≈ 0.062mol

m (Na2SO4) = 0.062mol x 142.04g/mol =8.8g
w%= 8.8g/820g x100% = 1.07%

A: sodium sulfate w(%) in the solution is approximately 1.07%.

not correct: 
sodium mass fraction:
w(%) = mass of Na2SO4·10H2O / Total mass of the solution × 100%
    = (0.062 mol x 322,1g/mol )/(800g)
    = 2.5%

A: sodium sulfate w(%) in the solution is approximately 2.5%.

3. During 24 hours, an average amount of 800 mL of gastric juice is secreted in the stomach (ρ = 1.065 g/mL). Gastric acid contains ≈ 0.5% hydrogen chloride. Calculate the total mass of hydrogen chloride that enters the stomach with gastric acid daily!

**My solution**
```
V  = 800ml 
V Hydrogen chloride = 0.005 x 800ml = 4ml
p = m/V
m = pV
m = 1.065g/ml x 4ml = 4.26ml

A: 4.26ml (HCI) 
```

4. Calculate the mass and amount of aluminium ions that are in 300 mL of 24 % aluminium sulfate solution (ρ = 1.309 g/mL).

**My solution**
```
amount of something in chemistry means moles.

m = pV

m of the solution = 300ml x 1.309 g/ml =  392.7g
m(aluminium sulfate) = 392.7g x 0.24 = 94.25g
M (aluminium sulfate ) = 342.17g/mol
n (aluminium sulfate) = m/M = 94.25g/ 342.17g/mol ≈ 0.2755mol
mol of aluminium ions (3) = 0.2755mol x 3 = 0.8265mol

A: 0.8265mol of aluminium ions in 300ml of the 24% aluminium sulfate solution.
```

5. A 0.84 M solution of acetic acid is given, its density is 1.01 g/mL. Calculate the mass fraction of acetic acid (%) in the solution.

**My solution**
```
p = 1.01g/ml
c= 0.84 mol/L

(you can choose the volume since we have one concentration and we have to go to another concentration)

m mass of the solution = volume x density = 1L x 1.01 g/ml = 1010g
n = 0.84mol/L x 1L = 0.84mol

M (CH3COOH) = 60.03g/mol
m = nM = 0.84mol x 60.03g/mol = 50.43g

w% ( mass of acetic acid/ mass of solution) x 100% = 50.43g/1010g = 4.99%

A: the mass fraction of acetic acid in the solution is approximately 5%.
```
6.  You have a stock solution of 14.8 M NH3. How many millilitres of this solution should you dilute to make 100.0 mL of 0.250 M NH3? If you take a 10.0 mL portion of the stock solution and dilute it to the total volume of 0.250 L, what will be the concentration of the final solution?

**My solution**

```
C1 = 14.8M
V1 = ? 
V2 mass of NH3 = 100.0ml
C2(NH3) = 0.250 M

V1 = C2*V2/C1
     = 0.250 M * 0.100 L /14.8 M
     = 0.1689 L ≈ 169 ml

C1= 14.8 M
V1 = 0.010L or 10.0ml
V2 = 0.250L = 250ml
C2=?

C2 = C1*V1/V2
     = 14.8M* 0.010L/0.250L
     ≈0.59 M (mol/L)

7. How many mL of 95.12% sulfuric acid (𝜌𝐻2𝑆𝑂4,95.12%=1.834 𝑔/𝑚𝐿) are needed to prepare  200 mL of 8.415% H2SO4 (𝜌𝐻2𝑆𝑂4,8.415%=1.055 𝑔/𝑚𝐿)?

**My solution**
```
p (density of sulfuric acid H2SO4, w% = 95.12%) = 1.834g/mL
p (density of H2SO4, w% = 8.415%) = 1.055 g/mL
Volume of 200ml of 8.415% of H2SO4 
Volume of 95.1% H2SO4 = ml?

m = pV 
Mass of diluted solution = 1.055g/ml x 200 ml = 211g
Mass of the solute H2SO4 = 8.415% x 211g = 17.76g

Mass of concentrated solution = M(H2So4) / w% x100 =17.76g / 95.12 x100 = 18.67g

Vc = 18.67g/ 1.834g/mol = 10.2ml

- a) Cr2(SO4)3 + NaOH → 
- b) HBr + Ba(OH)2 →
- c) NaCl + NiSO4 →
- d) Na2CO3 + HNO3 →

**My solution**

     2 Cr ^3+ + 3 SO^2-

9. Write the expression for Kc (equilibrium constant) for the following reactions. In each case indicate whether the reaction is homogeneous or heterogeneous.

- c) HF (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + F- (aq)
- d) 2Ag (s) + Zn2+ (aq) ⇌ 2Ag+ (aq) + Zn (s)

**My solution**
```
a) Kc = CS2 * (H2)^2 / CH4 * (H2S)^2 homogeneous, all species are in the gas phase.
b) Kc = (CO)^4 / Ni(CO)^4 heterogeneous, involves species in both the gas phase and the solid phase
c) Kc = (H+)(F-)/ (HF) homogeneous because all species are in liquid phase 
d) Kc = (Ag+)^2 / (Zn2+) heterogeneous because it involves species in solid and liquid phase
